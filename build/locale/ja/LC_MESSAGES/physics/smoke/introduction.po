"Smoke simulation is used to simulate the fluid movement of air and generate "
"animated :term:`voxel` textures representing the density, heat, and velocity"
" of other fluids or suspended particles (i.e. smoke) which can be used for "
"rendering."

"Smoke and fire are emitted into a :doc:`Domain</physics/smoke/domain>` from "
"a mesh object or particle system. Smoke movement is controlled by airflow "
"inside the domain, which can be influenced by :doc:`smoke collision objects "
"</physics/smoke/collisions>`. Smoke will also be affected by scene gravity "
"and :doc:`force fields</physics/force_fields>`. Airflow inside the domain "
"can affect other physics simulations via the smoke flow force field."
