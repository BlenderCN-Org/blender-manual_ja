"The `Simple Motion`_ actuator gives control over position and velocity, but "
"does this as an instant displacement; the object never passes any of the "
"coordinates between the start and end positions. This can interfere with the"
" physical simulation of other objects, and can cause an object to go through"
" another object. The `Servo Control`_ actuator does not suffer from this, "
"since it produces physically correct velocities, and leaves updating the "
"position to the physics simulation."

"The Servo Control actuator influences the velocity of a game object by "
"applying forces, resulting in correct behavior when colliding with other "
"objects controlled by the physics simulation. The amount of force necessary "
"is determined by a `PID controller`_, a type of controller that is often "
"used in control systems. Only the positional velocity is influenced by this "
"actuator; it does not control rotation at all, and it controls position only"
" indirectly."

"Controlling the position is not necessary in that respect; that is left to a"

" target velocity."

"This controls the reaction to the sum of errors so far. Using only the "
"Proportional component results in a systematic velocity error if there is "
"friction: some velocity delta is necessary to produce the force that "
"compensates the friction. Using the Integral component suppresses this "
"effect (the target velocity is achieved on average) but can create "
"oscillations; the control will speed to compensate the initial velocity "
"error. To avoid the oscillation, the Proportional component must be used "
"with the Integral component (the Proportional component damps the control) "

"you change the Integral Coefficient."
