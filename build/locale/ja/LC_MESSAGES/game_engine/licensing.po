"Blender and the Blender Game Engine (BGE) is licensed as GNU GPL, which "
"means that your games (if they include Blender software) have to comply with"
" that license as well. This only applies to the software, or the bundle if "
"it has software in it, not to the artwork you make with Blender. All your "
"Blender creations are your sole property."

"GNU GPL - also called \"Free Software\" - is a license that aims at keeping "
"the licensed software free, forever. GNU GPL does not allow you to add new "
"restrictions or limitations on the software you received under that license."
" That works fine if you want your clients or your audience to have the same "
"rights as you have (with Blender)."

"In this case, you could decide to load and run another .blend file game "
"(using the Game Actuator logic brick). That file then is not part of the "
