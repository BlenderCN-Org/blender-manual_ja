"Scenes are a very useful tool for managing your projects. The Cube model in "
"empty space you see when you open Blender for the first time is the default "
"Scene. You can imagine Scenes to be similar to tabs in your web browser. For"
" example, your web browser can have many tabs open at once. The tabs could "
"be empty, showing identical views of the same web page, showing different "
"views of the same page or show entirely different pages altogether. "
"Blender's Scenes work in much the same way. You can have an empty Scene, a "
"complete independent copy of your Scene or a new copy that links to your "
"original Scene in a number of ways."

"To choose between these options, you need to clearly understand the "
"difference between \"Objects\" and \"Object Data\". Each Blender graphic "
"element (Mesh, Lamp, Curve, *etc.*) is composed from two parts: an Object "
"and Object Data (also known as ObData). The Object holds information about "
"the position, rotation and size of a particular element. The ObData holds "
"information about meshes, material lists and so on. ObData is common to "
"every instance of that particular type of element. Each Object has a link to"
" its associated ObData, and a single ObData may be shared by many Objects."
