"Once the owner object has had a Damped Track constraint applied to it, you "
"must then choose which axis of the object you want to point at the Target "
"object.  You can choose between 6 axis directions (-X, -Y, -Z, X, Y, Z).  "
"The negative axis direction cause the object to point away from the Target "
