"Constraints are a way of connecting *transform properties* (position, "

"*data* (i.e. meshes, curves, etc.)."

"Even though constraints might be very useful in static scenes (as they can "
"help to automatically position/rotate/scale objects), they were first "
"designed for animation, as they allow you to limit/control the freedom of an"
" object, either in absolute (i.e. in global space), or relatively to other "
"objects."
