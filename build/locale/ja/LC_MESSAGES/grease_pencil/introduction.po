"Use the *Grease Pencil* tool to draw freehand sketches and annotations in "

#~ "The *Grease Pencil* is a tool that allows you to draw sketches and "
#~ "annotations in the 3D view and UV/Image editor windows using freehand "
#~ "strokes. It is a tool that can be linked back to traditional 2D paper and "
#~ "pencil workflows where rough \"guideline\" sketches were often used for "
#~ "planning and quickly communicating ideas. In digital fields, a similar "
#~ "workflow was used by drawing on monitors with wax crayons and pencils. It is"
#~ " often useful to be able to directly scribble on to a work in progress "
#~ "instead of having to do so in a separate place (i.e. another part of the "
#~ "window, or even in a different application altogether)."
