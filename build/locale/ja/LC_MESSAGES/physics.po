"Cloth simulation is one of the hardest aspects of CG, because it is a "

"development, Blender has a very robust cloth simulator that is used to make "
"clothing, flags, banners, and so on. Cloth interacts with and is affected by"
" other moving objects, the wind and other forces, as well as a general "
"aerodynamic model, all of which is under your control."

"A piece of cloth is any mesh, open or enclosed, that has been designated as "
"cloth. The *Cloth* panels are located in the *Physics* sub-context and "
"consist of three panels of options. Cloth is either an open or closed mesh "
"and is mass-less, in that all cloth is assumed to have the same density, or "
"mass per square unit."

"Cloth is commonly modeled as a mesh grid primitive, or a cube, but can also "
"be, for example, a teddy bear. However, Blender's :doc:`Softbody system "

"a specialized simulation of fabrics."

"Once the object is designated as Cloth, a Cloth :doc:`modifier </modifiers>`"

":doc:`modifier </modifiers>` then, it can interact with other modifiers, "
