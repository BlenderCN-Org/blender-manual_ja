#~ "Blender supports a wide mix of image formats. These formats are listed in "
#~ "alphabetical order."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "There are many image formats out there for many different uses. A format "
#~ "stores an image in a *loss-less* or lossy format; with lossy formats you "
#~ "suffer some image degradation but save disk space because the image is saved"
#~ " using fewer bytes. A loss-less format preserves the image exactly, pixel "
#~ "for pixel. You can break formats down into *static* images and movie "
#~ "*clips*."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Within either category there are standards (static formats and clip codecs) "
#~ "which may be proprietary standards (developed and controlled by one "
#~ "company), or open standards (which are community or consortium-controlled). "
#~ "Open standards generally outlive any one particular company and will always "
#~ "be royalty-free and freely obtained by the viewer. Proprietary formats may "
#~ "only work with a specific video card, or while the codec may be free, the "
#~ "viewer may cost."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Compression"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Some formats can compress the image to use less disk space. This compression"
#~ " might be loss-less (PNG, ...) or lossy (Jpeg, ...). Lossy formats don't "
#~ "store individual pixel information, thus reducing image quality. All the "
#~ "other formats are more or less equivalent, each having advantages and "
#~ "disadvantages. Make your compression selection using the button or field "
#~ "located beneath the format selector. For example, if Jpeg is selected, you "
#~ "can specify a compression level (Quality:90 by default). Higher quality "
#~ "takes more disk space, but results in a better looking picture with less "
#~ "compression encoding artifacts."
