"Next to lighting from the background and any object with an emission shader,"
" lamps are another way to add light into the scene. The difference is that "
"they are not directly visible in the rendered image, and can be more easily "
"managed as objects of their own type."

"Currently **Point**, **Spot**, **Area** and **Sun** lamps are supported. "
"Hemi lamps are not supported, and will be rendered as point and sun lamps "
"respectively, but they may start working in the future, so it's best not to "
"enable them to preserve compatibility."
