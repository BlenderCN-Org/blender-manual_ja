"The translate node translates (moves) an image by the specified amounts in "
"the X and Y directions. X and Y are in pixels, and can be positive or "
"negative. To shift an image up and to the left, for example, you would "
"specify a negative X offset and a positive Y."

"Use this node to position an image into the final composite image. Usually, "
"the output of this node is routed to an AlphaOver or Mix node to mix it with"
" a base image. In the example below, the RenderLayer input from one scene "
"(box) is translated over to the left (a negative X translation) and "
"alphaovered with a Hello scene RenderLayer input"

"At the end of your fantastic animation, you'll want to give credit where "
"credit is due. This is called rolling the credits and you see the names of "
"everyone involved scroll up over a background image or sequence. The mini-"

"In this node map, the RenderLayer input has a list of the people involved "
"and is 150 pixels high; it is the image input into the Translate Node. The Y"
" value (vertical) offset of the Translate node comes from a scaled time "
"factor that varies from -150 to 150 over 30 frames. The Translated image is "
"overlaid on top of a background swirl image. So, over the course of 30 "
"frames, the Translate node shifts the image from down by 150 pixels (off the"
" bottom of the screen), up through and overlaid on top of the swirl, and "
"finally off the screen to the top. These frames are generated when the "
"Render Animation buttons are set and Anim is pressed. Right now, frame 21 is"
" showing Moe and Curly, and Larry has scrolled off the screen."

"You *could* have parented and animated all of the text to roll up past your "
"camera, but rendering would have taken forever. Using the translate node is "
"much faster to composite, and more flexible. To add someone to the list, "
"simply change the credits image and re-animate. Since it is simple image "
"manipulation, Blender is blazingly fast at regenerating your credits. "
"Similarly, changing the background is rock simple as well; simply load up a "
"different background image and re-Animate."

msgid ""
"In some 2D and 3D animations and movies, a matte painting is used as the "
"background. In most scenes it is still, however you can easily move it using"
" the Translate node. Mattes are huge; the example used below is actually "
"1440x600 pixels, even though the scene being rendered is for TV. This "
"oversizing gives us room to move the matte around. The example noodle below "
"introduces a dancing \"Hello!\" from stage right in frames 1-30. As the "
"\"Hello\" reaches center stage, we fake a camera move by moving the matte to"
" the left, which makes it look like the \"Hello!\" is still moving as the "
"camera moves with it."

"Use the Map Value node to scale the X (left to right) offsets that feed the "

"\"Hello!\" down to look like it is walking along the street (in the render "

"adjusted up to fake a camera height of an observer, bringing the horizon up."

"A real world effect is the shaking of the camera. BOOM! We expect to feel "
"the impact and see it rock our world. In our virtual CG world, though, we "
"are in the vaccuum of space. So, we have to fake a camera being shook. There"
" are two points in the development cycle to do this: at *Render-Scene* time,"
" and at *Composite* time."

"At *Render-Scene* time, the modeler would introduce an Ipo curve and "
"keyframes that rotate and/or move the camera for a short amount of time. The"
" advantage to render-scene shake is that the artist handles it and the "
"editor does not have to worry about it; one less thing to do thank goodness."
" The disadvantage is that the artist may only be modeling the actors, and "
"not the background scenery, props, or matte, so any shake they introduce "
"does not transfer to the set, props, or backdrop. Therefore, it is best to "
"introduce camera shake after all scenes have been rendered and assembled and"
" when they are being composited."

"There are two aspects to being bumped, or tripping over the tripod, or "
"having an explosion go off next to you, or an airplane have a near miss as "

"**Camera Motion** happens because the camera physically gets moved; but its "
"mass and its tripod also acts as a dampening device, softening out and "
"absorbing the initial bump. The cameraman also acts as a dampener, and also "
"as a corrector, trying to get the camera back to where it was pointed "
"originally."

"There can be quite a delay between the shock and the correction; for "
"example, a lone actor/cameraman may trip on the tripod coming out from "
"behind the camera, come into frame, realize the camera is off, and then come"

"want to convey."

"The *image blur* comes into play because the shake happens so rapidly that "
"the image is blurred in the direction of the shake. However, the blur is "
"more when the camera is being pushed back into position, and less when the "
"camera is at the extreme of its deflection, since it is decelerating at the "
"apex of its movement. Like motion, blur is the most during the initial "
"shock, and less as things slow down and get under control. Also, the camera "
"may go out of focus and come back into focus at the end of the shake."

"In the above example, we use a Time curve that mimics the intensity and "
"duration of a typical BOOM!. In this case, both curves have four peaks "
"within a 16-frame period to mimic a BOOM! (in fact one curve was constructed"
" and then duplicated to make the other, to ensure that the bulk of both "
"curves was exactly the same). Notice how the curve dampens (decreases in "
"magnitude as time progresses) as discussed above. Notice how the curve slows"
" down (increasing period) to mimic the cameraman getting it back under "
"control. Notice that the curve is sinusoidal to mimic over-correction and "
"vibration."

"BOOM! to the Left: The translate curve starts at 0.5. Maximum deflection up "

"Motion and Blur are the same but different: Notice that the two curves are "

"Use this Blender noodle to mimic camera shake. The amount of shake is set by"
" the *Size* values, and the blur should be proportional to the amount and "
"direction of motion (predominantly X in this example). Use the Time start "
"and end to vary the duration of the shake; ten seconds for an earthquake, "
"one minute for a ship rolling in the seas, a half second as an F-14 flies by"
" and takes your ear off. *Author's note: I noticed cool camera shakes while "
"watching the Halo 3 previews.*"
