"Compositing Nodes allow you to assemble and enhance an image (or movie). "
"Using composition nodes, you can glue two pieces of footage together and "
"colorize the whole sequence all at once. You can enhance the colors of a "
"single image or an entire movie clip in a static manner or in a dynamic way "
"that changes over time (as the clip progresses). In this way, you use "
"composition nodes to both assemble video clips together, and enhance them."
