"Light wouldn't even exist without its counterpart: shadows. Shadows are a "
"darkening of a portion of an object because light is being partially or "
"totally blocked from illuminating the object. They add contrast and volume "
"to a scene; there is nearly no place in the real world without shadows, so "
"to get realistic renders, you will need them. Blender supports the following"
" kinds of shadows:"

"As opposed to FIXME(Link Type Unsupported: #lamps; [[#Lamps: Buffered "

"tracer then records which pixel of the final image is hit by a ray light, "

"For a scanline renderer - and Blender's built-in engine *is*, among other "

"of view, is \"rendered\" and that the distance - in the image - for each "
"point from the spot light is saved. Any point in the \"rendered\" image that"
