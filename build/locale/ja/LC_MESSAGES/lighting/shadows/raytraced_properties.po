"The Monte Carlo method is a method of taking a series of samples/readings of"
" values (any kind of values, such as light values, color values, reflective "
"states) in or around an area at random, so as to determine the correct "
"actions to take in certain calculations which usually require multiple "
"sample values to determine overall accuracy of those calculations. The Monte"
" Carlo method tries to be as random as possible; this can often cause areas "
"that are being sampled to have large irregular gaps in them (places that are"
" not sampled/read). This in turn can cause problems for certain calculations"
" (such as shadow calculation)."
