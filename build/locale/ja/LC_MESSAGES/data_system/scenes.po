#~ "by default (even though you can change to seconds too if you wish), and "
#~ "typical video has 25 or 30 frames per second (fps), and film is 24 fps. For "
#~ "a five-second shot then, you allocate up to 150 frames for that shot (30 fps"
#~ " × 5 seconds). Giving yourself some wiggle-room, shot 2 would start at frame"
#~ " 250 and go from there. A one-minute movie set in a single scene for North "
#~ "America video broadcast (NTSC standard) would have a timeline that goes up "
#~ "to 1800 final frames, and may be laid out over the course of 2500 frames. "
#~ "This timeline allows for cutting out 700 frames, picking the best 1800 "
