"Cineon is Kodak's standard for film scanning, 10 bits/channel and "
"logarithmic. DPX has been derived from Cineon as the ANSI/SMPTE industry "
"standard. DPX supports 16 bits color/channel, linear as well as logarithmic."
" DPX is currently a widely adopted standard used in the film "
"hardware/software industry."
