"As we have seen in the :doc:`mesh structure page "
"</modeling/meshes/mesh_structures>`, meshes are made of different element "
"types (even though they are all inter-related: in a way, they are different "
"\"views\", \"representations\", of the same basic data...), \"vertices\", "
"\"edges\" and \"faces\"."

"Hence, you can select different parts of a mesh using one of these three "
"types. There is one key point to understand here: *when you select a type of"
" element (e.g. some edges), you* **implicitly** *select the other types of "
"corresponding elements (e.g. all vertices defining those edges, as well as "
"faces fully defined by these same edges)*. This is very important, as some "
"tools only work on vertices, edges and/or faces: if you use a \"face\" tool "
"with a selection of vertices, only the faces defined by these vertices will "
"be affected."
