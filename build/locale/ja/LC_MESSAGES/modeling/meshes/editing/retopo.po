"Retopology is a common part of modeling workflows. Often times, a model is "
"created with emphasis on form and detail, however, its topology, or edge "
"flow is not ideal, or the mesh is very dense, and not efficient. Modelers "
"can create a new lower resolution mesh that matches the form of the original"
" mesh."
