"Similar to shrink/flatten, this transformation consists of translating all "

"Average position of the points. All translations are of same value, and are "
"controlled by the mouse. It results in something that looks a bit like the "
"scale effect, but much more deforming."

"The *Warp* transformation is useful in very specific cases. It works by "
"warping the selected elements around the 3D cursor (always the 3D cursor; it"
" does not take into account the pivot point setting...). It is also view-"
"dependent. The points that line up vertically with the cursor will remain in"
" place. Each point's distance to the cursor's **horizontal position** "
"corresponds to the radius it will be from the cursor after the tool has been"
" activated. The tool will then wrap the point around the cursor. A value of "
"360 will wrap the mesh into a complete circle, so that the points furthest "
"to the left and the right will line up with each other and the cursor "
"position."

"The *Shear* transformation applies a shearing on your selection of elements "

"Everything that is \"above\" this axis (i.e. has a positive y-axis position)"
" will move (shear) in the same direction as your mouse pointer (but always "
