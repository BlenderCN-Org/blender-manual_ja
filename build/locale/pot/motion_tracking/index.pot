msgid "Blender's motion tracker supports a couple of very powerful tools for 2D tracking and 3D motion tracking, including camera tracking and object tracking, as well as some special features like the plane track for compositing. Tracks can also be used to move and deform masks for rotoscoping in the Mask Editor, which is available as a special mode in the Movie Clip Editor."

Such algorithms can be constructed, but they'll be really slow and they can still fail, so the only way to perform 2D tracking is to manually choose the tracking algorithm and its settings. Current defaults work nicely for general footage which isn't very blurry and where feature points aren't getting highly deformed by perspective."
