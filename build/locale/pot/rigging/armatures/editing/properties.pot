The same goes for mirroring, as it's nearly the same as with :doc:`mesh editing </modeling/meshes/tools/transform_deform#mirror>`. Just keep in mind that bones' roots and tips behave more or less like meshes' vertices, and bones themselves act like edges in a mesh."

However, connected bones must always have parent's tips connected to child's roots, so by transforming a bone, you will affect all its connected parent/children/siblings."
