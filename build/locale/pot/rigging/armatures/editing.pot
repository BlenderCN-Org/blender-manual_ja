Blender also features a more advanced \"armature sketching\" tool, called :doc:`Etch-a-Ton </rigging/armatures/editing/sketching>`.

msgid "One important thing to understand about armature editing is that you **edit the rest position of your armature**, i.e. its \"default state\". An armature in its *rest position* has all bones with no rotation and scaled to **1.0** in their own local space."

msgid "The different :doc:`poses </rigging/posing>` you might create afterwards are based on this rest position - so if you modify it in *Edit mode*, all the poses already existing will also be modified. Thus you should in general be sure that your armature is definitive before starting to :doc:`skin </rigging/skinning>` and :doc:`pose </rigging/posing>` it!"
