msgid "The *Track To* constraint applies rotations to its owner, so that it always points a given \"To\" axis towards its target, with another \"Up\" axis permanently maintained as much aligned with the global Z axis (by default) as possible. This tracking is similar to the \"billboard tracking\" in 3D (see note below)."

msgid "This constraint shares a close relationship to the :doc:`Inverse Kinematics constraint </rigging/constraints/tracking/ik_solver>` in some ways. It is very important in rig design, and you should be sure to read and understand the :doc:`2.49 BSoD tracking tutorial </ls/animation/techs/armatures/bsod/tracking>`, as it centers around the use of both of these constraints."

msgid "The term \"billboard\" has a specific meaning in real-time CG programming (i.e. video games!), where it is used for plane objects always facing the camera (they are indeed \"trackers\", the camera being their \"target\"). Their main usage is as support for tree or mist textures: if they were not permanently facing the camera, you would often see your trees squeezing to nothing, or your mist turning into a millefeuille paste, which would be funny but not so credible."
