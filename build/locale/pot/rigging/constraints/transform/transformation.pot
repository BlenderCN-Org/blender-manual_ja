msgid "This constraint is more complex and versatile than the other \"transform\" constraints. It allows you to map one type of transform properties (i.e. location, rotation or scale) of the target, to the same or another type of transform properties of the owner, within a given range of values (which might be different for each target and owner property). You can also switch between axes, and use the range values not as limits, but rather as \"markers\" to define a mapping between input (target) and output (owner) values."

When you enable this button, the *min* and *max* values are no longer strict limits, but rather \"markers\" defining a proportional (linear) mapping between input and corresponding output values. Let's illustrate that with two graphs (*The* *Extrapolate* *principles*). In these pictures, the input range (in abscissa) is set to [``1.0, 4.0``], and its corresponding output range (in ordinate), to [``1.0, 2.0``].
