msgid "The *Rigid Body Joint* constraint is very special. Basically, it is used by the physical part of the Blender Game Engine to simulate a joint between its owner and its target. It offers four joint types: hinge type, ball-and-socket type, cone-twist, and generic six-DoF (degrees of freedom) type."
