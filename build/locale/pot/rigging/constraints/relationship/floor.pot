msgid "The *Floor* constraint allows you to use its target position (and optionally rotation) to specify a plane with a \"forbidden side\", where the owner cannot go. This plane can have any orientation you like. In other words, it creates a floor (or a ceiling, or a wall)! Note that it is only capable of simulating entirely flat planes, even if you use the *Vertex Group* option. It cannot be used for uneven floors or walls."

msgid "This set of (mutually exclusive) buttons controls which plane will be the \"floor\". The buttons' names correspond indeed to the *normal* to this plane (e.g. enabling *Z* means \"XY plane\", etc.) By default, these normals are aligned with the *global* axes. However, if you enable *Use Rotation* (see above), they will be aligned with the *local target's axes*. As the constraint does not only define an uncrossable plane, but also a side of it which is forbidden to the owner, you can choose which side by enabling either the positive or negative normal axis... E.g, by default (*Z*), the owner is stuck in the positive Z coordinates."
