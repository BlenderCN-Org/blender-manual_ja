msgid "The *Shrinkwrap* constraint is the \"object counterpart\" of the :doc:`Shrinkwrap modifier </modifiers/deform/shrinkwrap>`. It moves the owner origin and therefore the owner object's location to the surface of its target."

# c264a847d2a04a969c3540301c8b6066
msgid "This implies that the target *must* have a surface. In fact, the constraint is even more selective, as it can only use meshes as targets. Hence, the *Shrinkwrap* option is only shown in the *Add Constraint to Active Object* menu, :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-C`, (or its bone's equivalent), when the selected inactive object is a mesh."

msgid "This numeric field controls the offset of the owner from the shrunk computed position on the target's surface. Positive values place the owner \"outside\" of the target, and negative ones, \"inside\" the target. This offset is applied along the straight line defined by the original (i.e. before constraint) position of the owner, and the computed one on the target's surface."

msgid "The target's surface's point is determined by projecting the owner's center along a given axis. This axis is controlled by the three *X*, *Y* and *Z* toggle buttons that show up when you select this type. This mean the projection axis can only be aligned with one of the global axes, median to both of them (XY, XZ or YZ), or to the three ones (XYZ). When the projection of the owner's center along the selected direction does not hit the target's surface, the owner's location is left unchanged."
