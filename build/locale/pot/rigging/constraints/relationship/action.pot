msgid "Note that even if the constraint accepts the *Mesh* action type, only the *Object*, *Pose* and *Constraint* types are really working, as constraints can only affect objects' or bones' transform properties, and not meshes' shapes... . Also note that only the object transformation (location, rotation, scale) is affected by the action, if the action contains keyframes for other properties they are ignored, as constraints do not influence those."

msgid "As an example, let's assume you have defined an *Object* action (it can be assigned to any object, or even no object at all), and have mapped it on your owner through an *Action* constraint, so that moving the target in the ``[0.0, 2.0]`` range along its X axis maps the action content on the owner in the ``[0, 100]`` frame range. This will mean that when the target's X property is **0.0**, the owner will be as if in frame **0** of the linked action; with the target's X property at **1.0**, the owner will be as if in frame **50** of the linked action, etc."
