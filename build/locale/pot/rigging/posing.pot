msgid "Once your armature is :doc:`skinned </rigging/skinning>` by the needed object(s), you can start to pose it. Basically, by transforming its bones, you deform or transform the skin object(s). But you don't do that in *Edit* mode - remember that in this mode, you edit *the default, base, \"rest\" position of your armature*. You can't use the *Object* mode either, as here you can only transform whole objects..."

msgid "So, armatures in Blender have a third mode, *Pose*, dedicated to this process. It's a sort of \"object mode for bones\". In rest position (as edited in *Edit* mode), each bone has its own position/rotation/scale to neutral values (i.e. ``0.0`` for position and rotation, and ``1.0`` for scale). Hence, when you edit a bone in *Pose* mode, you create an offset in its transform properties, from its rest position - this is quite similar to :doc:`meshes relative shape keys </animation/techs/shape/shape_keys>`, in fact."
