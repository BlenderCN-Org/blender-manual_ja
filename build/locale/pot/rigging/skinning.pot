msgid "We have seen in :doc:`previous pages </rigging/armatures>` how to design an armature, create chains of bones, etc. Now, having a good rig is not the final goal - unless you want to produce a \"Dance Macabre\" animation, you'll likely want to put some flesh on your skeletons! Surprisingly, \"linking\" an armature to the object(s) it should transform and/or deform is called the \"skinning\" process..."

This is the more complex and powerful method, and *the only way to really deform the geometry of the object*, i.e. to modify its vertices/control points relative positions."
