msgid "The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, Materials and Lights. In this part, we will delve deeper into the creation of the first of these: modeling. Modeling is the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics the shape of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects."

msgid "Mesh modeling typically begins with a primitive shape (e.g. circle, cube, cylinder...). This :doc:`Mesh Primitive </modeling/meshes/primitives>` is defined by an array of points in 3D space called vertices (singular form is :term:`Vertex`). From there you might begin extruding faces and moving vertices to create a larger, more complex shape."

msgid "Metaball modeling begins similarly to mesh modeling, with a base shape like a cube or sphere, but instead of extruding these base shapes, these objects are clumped together to form a larger object. In order to accomplish this, the metaballs have a liquid-like quality, when two or more are brought together they merge by smoothly rounding out the point of connection, appearing as one unified object."
