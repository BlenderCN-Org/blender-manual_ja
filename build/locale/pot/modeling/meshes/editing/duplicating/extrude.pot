msgid "One tool of paramount importance for working with meshes is the *Extrude* tool. It allows you to create parallelepipeds from rectangles and cylinders from circles, as well as easily create such things as tree limbs. *Extrude* is one of the most frequently used modeling tools in Blender. It's simple, straightforward, and easy to use, yet very powerful."

msgid "The selection is extruded along the common normal of selected faces. In every other case the extrusion can be limited to a single axis by specifying an axis (e.g. :kbd:`X` to limit to the X axis or :kbd:`Shift-X` to the YZ plane. When extruding along the face normal, limiting movement to the global Z axis requires pressing :kbd:`Z` twice, once to disable the face normal Z axis limit, and once to enable the global Z axis limit."

msgid "In other cases, the selected faces are linked to the newly created faces but not duplicated. This prevents undesired faces from being retained \"inside\" the resulting mesh. This distinction is extremely important since it ensures the construction of consistently coherent, closed volumes at all times when using *Extrude*."

msgid "*Extrude Individual* allows you to extrude a selection of multiple faces as individuals, instead of as a region. The faces are extruded along their own normals, rather than their average. This has several consequences: first, \"internal\" edges (i.e. edges between two selected faces) are no longer deleted (the original faces are)."
