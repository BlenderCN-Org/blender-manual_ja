msgid "In *Edit mode*, the *Warp* transformation takes selected elements and warps them around the 3D cursor by a certain angle. Note that this transformation is always dependent on the location of the 3D cursor. The Pivot Point is not taken into account. The results of the *Warp* transformation are also view dependent."

msgid "Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *Warp* transform function. The *Warp* option can be invoked from the :menuselection:`Object/Mesh/Curve/Surface --> Transform --> Warp` menu option. The amount of warping given to the selection can be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a number. Pressing :kbd:`Return` will confirm the transformation. The confirmed transformation can be further edited by pressing :kbd:`F6` or by going into the Toolshelf (:kbd:`T`) and altering the Angle slider provided that no other actions take place between the *Warp* transform confirmation and accessing the slider."
