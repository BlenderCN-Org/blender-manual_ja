msgid "Shearing is a form of movement where parallel surfaces move past one another. During this transform, movement of the selected elements will occur along the horizontal axis of the current view. The axis location will be defined by the *Pivot Point*. Everything that is \"above\" this axis will move (Shear) in the same direction as your mouse pointer (but always parallel to the horizontal axis). Everything that is \"below\" the horizontal axis will move in the opposite direction."

msgid "Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *Shear* transform function. The *Shear* option can be invoked from the :menuselection:`Object/Mesh/Curve/Surface --> Transform --> Shear` menu option or by pressing :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-S`. The amount of movement given to the selection can be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a number. Pressing :kbd:`Return` will confirm the transformation. The confirmed transformation can be further edited by pressing F6 or by going into the Toolshelf (:kbd:`T`) and altering the Offset slider provided that no other actions take place between the *Shear* transform confirmation and accessing the slider."

In frame B, the *Pivot Point* is set to *Median Point* (indicated by the yellow line) and the mouse was moved to the left during the transform. In frame C, the *Pivot Point* is set to the 3D cursor which is located above the mesh (indicated again by the yellow line). When the mouse is moved to the left during a *Shear* transform the selected vertices are moved to the right as they are below the horizontal axis."

In frame C, the *Pivot Point* is set to the 3D cursor which is located above the Objects (indicated again by the yellow line). When the mouse is moved to the left during a *Shear* transform all of the selected Objects are moved to the right as they are below the horizontal axis.
