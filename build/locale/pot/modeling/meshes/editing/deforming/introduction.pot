msgid "Similar to shrink/flatten, this transformation consists of translating all selected elements along the line joining their original position to the Average position of the points. All translations are of same value, and are controlled by the mouse. It results in something that looks a bit like the scale effect, but much more deforming."

msgid "The *Warp* transformation is useful in very specific cases. It works by warping the selected elements around the 3D cursor (always the 3D cursor; it does not take into account the pivot point setting...). It is also view-dependent. The points that line up vertically with the cursor will remain in place. Each point's distance to the cursor's **horizontal position** corresponds to the radius it will be from the cursor after the tool has been activated. The tool will then wrap the point around the cursor. A value of 360 will wrap the mesh into a complete circle, so that the points furthest to the left and the right will line up with each other and the cursor position."

msgid "The *Shear* transformation applies a shearing on your selection of elements (in *Edit* mode, vertices/edges/control points/...). Like the other transform tools, it uses the view space, and is centered on the pivot point: the shear occurs along the view's x-axis passing through the pivot point. Everything that is \"above\" this axis (i.e. has a positive y-axis position) will move (shear) in the same direction as your mouse pointer (but always parallel to the x-axis). And everything that is \"below\" this x-axis will move in the opposite direction. The further away from the x-axis an element is, the more it moves."
