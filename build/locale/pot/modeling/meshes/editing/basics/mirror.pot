msgid "The *X-mirror* option of the *Mesh Options* panel allows you edit both \"sides\" of your mesh in a single action. When you transform an element (vertex, edge or face), if there is its *exact X-mirrored counterpart* (in local space), it will be transformed accordingly, *through a symmetry along the local X axis*."

msgid "When using the *X Mirror* option to work on mirrored Mesh Geometry the vertices that are mirrored must be perfectly placed. If they are not exactly positioned in their mirror locations then *X Mirror* will not treat those vertices as mirrored. This can be annoying because often the out of position vertices are only very slightly out of position."

msgid "*Topology Mirror* tries to solve this problem by determining which vertices are mirrored vertices not only by using their positions but also by looking at how those vertices are related to others in the Mesh Geometry. It looks at the overall Mesh Geometry topology to determine if particular vertices will be treated as mirrored. The effect of this is that mirrored vertices can be non-symetrical and yet still be treated as mirrored when *X Mirror* and *Topology Mirror* are both active."
