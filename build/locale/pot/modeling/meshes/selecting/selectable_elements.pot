msgid "As we have seen in the :doc:`mesh structure page </modeling/meshes/mesh_structures>`, meshes are made of different element types (even though they are all inter-related: in a way, they are different \"views\", \"representations\", of the same basic data...), \"vertices\", \"edges\" and \"faces\"."

msgid "Hence, you can select different parts of a mesh using one of these three types. There is one key point to understand here: *when you select a type of element (e.g. some edges), you* **implicitly** *select the other types of corresponding elements (e.g. all vertices defining those edges, as well as faces fully defined by these same edges)*. This is very important, as some tools only work on vertices, edges and/or faces: if you use a \"face\" tool with a selection of vertices, only the faces defined by these vertices will be affected."

msgid "In general, you will only select one type of element at a time, depending on the \"select mode\" you are using. However, you can successively add different elements to a same selection, switching between these select modes (see `Selected elements after switching select mode`_ for what is selected after switching select mode), or even use a \"combined\" select mode, also described below."
