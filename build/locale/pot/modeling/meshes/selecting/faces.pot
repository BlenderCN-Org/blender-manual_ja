msgid "Face Loops are pretty much the same as Edge Rings. If you want to select a Face Loop, there is no menu entry that works based on a selected face. Using :menuselection:`Select --> Edge Ring` would select a \"cross\" with the prior selected face as the middle. If you want to avoid switching to Edge Select Mode to select a Face Loop, use the :kbd:`Alt-RMB` shortcut."

If these edges are desired and you want to work on them, switch in Edge Select Mode.

Two times, because the first click will remove the selected face loop (in this case, just the original selected face), while the second click will add the whole vertical running loop to the selection, creating the cross."

msgid "As already known, faces are marked with a little square dot in the middle of the face. With ngons that can lead in certain cases to a confusing display. The example shows the center dot of the U-shaped ngon being inside of the oblong face inside the \"U\". It is not easy to say which dot belongs to which face (the orange dot in the image is the object center). Luckily, you don't need to care much - because to select a face, you don't have to click the center dot, but the face itself."
