msgid "Scaling the inner green circle changes the *Stiffness* value. Stiffness defines how much the meta object is filled. This essentially defines how sensitive a meta is to being affected by other metas. With a low stiffness, the meta will begin to deform from further away. A higher value means the meta needs to be close to another one to begin merging."

msgid "This discussion of \"polygonization\" *doesn't* mean that the various meshes don't deform towards or away from each other (meta objects always influence one another in the usual way, whether or not they are members of the same family). Rather, it means that the underlying mesh structure changes only when the *base* object transforms. For example, if you scale the *base*, the children's mesh structure changes. In (*Scaling the \"base\"*), the *base* has been scaled down, which has the effect of scaling the mesh structure of each of the children. As you can see, the children's mesh resolution has increased, while the *base* decreased. *The children did not change size!*"
