This is why this form of duplication is sometimes called \"shallow link\", because not all datablocks are shared; some of them are \"hard copied\"!"

This will create a new object with **all** of its data linked to the original object. If you modify one of the linked objects in *Edit mode*, all linked copies are modified. Transform properties (object datablocks) still remain copies, not links, so you still can rotate, scale, and move freely without affecting the other copy.
