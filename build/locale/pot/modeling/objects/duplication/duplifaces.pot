msgid "The positioning of the duplicated geometry relative to the face is dependent upon the position of the child objects relative to the duplicator's origin. This can lead to some visual artifacts in the editor as the geometry of the original objects overlaps or intersects with the duplicates. One workaround is to move the origin of the duplicator mesh off of the plane of the faces."

msgid "However, there is a workflow that lets you control for this. Make a single square and enable the Duplication / Faces so you can see the duplicated geometry in your editor window. If the orientation is not what you want, rotate the face until it is how you want. Typically you want to do the rotation in Edit mode, not Object mode, but this is not a hard rule."

msgid "Once you have the orientation correct, Duplicate the face and move the duplicate where you want it. Repeat this process until you have enough faces. Since it is common for these faces to butt up against one another, your geometry will have lots of duplicate vertices. Use the Remove Doubles button in the Tools panel."
