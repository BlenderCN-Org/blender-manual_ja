msgid "Curve selection in *Edit* mode is much less complex than with meshes! Mainly this is because you have only one selectable element type, the control points (no select mode needed here...). These points are a bit more complex than simple vertices, however, especially for Béziers, as there is the central vertex, and its two handles..."

msgid "One word about the Bézier control points: when you select the main central vertex, the two handles are automatically selected too, so you can grab it as a whole, without creating an angle in the curve. However, when you select a handle, only this vertex is selected, allowing you to modify this control vector..."
