msgid "*Curve Deform* provides a simple but efficient method of defining a deformation on a mesh. By parenting a mesh object to a curve, you can deform the mesh up or down the curve by moving the mesh along, or orthogonal to, the dominant axis. This is a most useful tool to make an object follow a complex path, like e.g. a sheet of paper inside a printer, a film inside a camera, the water of a canal..."

msgid "The *Curve Deform* works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. This means that when you move your mesh in the dominant direction, the mesh will traverse along the curve. Moving the mesh in an orthogonal direction will move the mesh object closer or further away from the curve. The default settings in Blender map the Y axis to the dominant axis. When you move the object beyond the curve endings the object will continue to deform based on the direction vector of the curve endings."

msgid "With closed curves, the taper curve in *TaperOb* acts along the whole curve (perimeter of the object), not just the length of the object, and varies the extrusion depth. In these cases, you want the relative height of the *TaperOb* Taper curve at both ends to be the same, so that the cyclic point (the place where the endpoint of the curve connects to the beginning) is a smooth transition."

Add another one (a closed one, like a circle); call it ``BevelCurve``, and enter its name in the *BevOb* field of the first curve (*Editing* context :kbd:`F9`, *Curve and Surface* panel). We now have a pipe. Add a third curve while in *Object* mode and call it ``TaperCurve``. Adjust the left control-point by raising it up about 5 units."
