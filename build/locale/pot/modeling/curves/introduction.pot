Bezier curves are generally more intuitive because they start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBs curves are more efficient for the computer to calculate when there are many twists and turns in a curve."

For an introduction, please consult the `Wikipedia page. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NURBS>`__ In practice, many of the Bezier curve operations discussed above apply to NURBS curves in the same manner. The following text will concentrate only on those aspects that are unique to NURBS curves."
