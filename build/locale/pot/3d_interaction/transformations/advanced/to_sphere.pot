msgid "Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *To Sphere* transform function. The *To Sphere* option can be invoked from the :menuselection:`Mesh --> Transform --> To Sphere` menu option or by pressing :kbd:`Shift-Alt-S`. The amount of sphericity given to the selection can be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a number between 0 and 1. Pressing :kbd:`Enter` will confirm the transformation. The confirmed transformation can be further edited by pressing :kbd:`F6` or by going into the *Toolshelf* (:kbd:`T`) and altering the *Factor* slider provided that no other actions take place between the *To Sphere* transform confirmation and accessing the slider."
