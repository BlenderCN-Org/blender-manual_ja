msgid "The bounding box is a rectangular box that is wrapped as tightly as possible around the selection. It is oriented parallel to the world axes. In this mode the pivot point lies at the center of the bounding box. You can set the pivot point to bounding box with the :kbd:`,` hotkey or via the menu in the *Window Header*. The image below shows how the Object's Bounding Box size is determined by the size of the Object."

msgid "For example, images A (before rotation) and B show rotation when the Object center is in its default position, while images C (before rotation) and D shows the result when the Object center has been moved. Image E shows that when multiple Objects are selected, the pivot point is calculated based on the Bounding Box of all the selected Objects."
