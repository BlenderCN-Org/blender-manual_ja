msgid "Classical hand-drawn animators often made a chart, showing exactly when each drawing, sound and camera move would occur, and for how long. They nicknamed this the 'dopesheet'. While CG foundations dramatically differ from classical hand-drawn animation, Blender's Dopesheet inherits a similar directive. It gives the animator a 'birds-eye-view' of every thing occurring within a scene."

The Y-axis has no mean in itself, unlike with the FCurve editor, it's just a sort of \"stack\" of action channels - each one being shown as an horizontal colored strip (of a darker shade \"during\" the animated/keyed period). On these channel strips lay the keyframes, materialized as light-gray (unselected) or yellow (selected) diamonds. One of the key feature of this window is that it allow you to visualize immediately which channel (i.e. Ipo curve) is *really* affected. When the value of a given channel does not change at all between two neighboring keyframes, a gray (unselected) or yellow (selected) line is drawn between them."
