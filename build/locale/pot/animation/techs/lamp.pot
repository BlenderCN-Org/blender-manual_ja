msgid "We won't detail the cave and torch creation - the first one is an deformed icosphere with *Subsurf* and :doc:`Displace modifiers </modifiers/deform/displace>`, and the second one, a cylinder scaled and subdivided several times in its length, with a :doc:`particle system </physics/particles/index>` to materialize its fire."

msgid "The torch will be the only light source of the scene. Add four *Lamp* lamps, all using the same lamp datablock. Place them around the tip of the torch, and parent them to it. Give them an orange color (e.g. ``(1.0, 0.8, 0.4)``), a short *Distance* (``2.0``, but this depends on the size of your cave!), and an *Inverse Square* falloff. Also let them cast ray shadows (soft shadows, if you have enough computing power)."

msgid "Right click on the *Energy* parameter and *Insert Keyframe* to create an Fcurve, then open the graph editor to edit the keyframes. You can for example start at zero (no energy, the scene is whole black), give a short and intense flash (``10`` over a few frames) to simulate a sort of lightning lighting the fire, then back to very low (``0.25``), and then a gently varying curve over the rest of the scene, to simulate the irregularities of the flames."
