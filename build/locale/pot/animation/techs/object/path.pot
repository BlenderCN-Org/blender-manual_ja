msgid "To make objects move along a path is a very common animation need. Think of a complex camera traveling, a train on his rails - and most other vehicles can also use \"invisible\" tracks! -, the links of a bicycle chain, etc. All these movements could obviously be done with standard Ipo curves, but this would be a nightmare! It's much more easy and intuitive to define a path materializing the desired movement, and make your object(s) follow it."

msgid "In Blender, any :doc:`curve object </modeling/curves/introduction>` can become a path. A curve becomes a path when its *Path Animation* button is enabled in the *Curve* data panel, but you don't even have to bother about this: once a curve is selected as target for a \"path\" constraint, it automatically is enabled."

msgid "You can also directly add a \"path\" from the :menuselection:`Add --> Curve --> Path` menu entry (in a 3D view). This will insert in your scene a *three-dimensional* NURBS curve. This is an important point: by default, Blender's curve are 2 dimensional, i.e. are laid on a plane, which is often not the desired behavior of a path. To turn a standard curve three-dimensional, enable its *3D* button, in the same *Curve and Surface* editing panel."
