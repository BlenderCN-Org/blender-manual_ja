msgid "As an example, we are going to create a nice and impressive camera effect, which you can see e.g. in the first part of the Lord of the Ring: the *transtrav*. Basically, the idea is to combine a forward zoom with a backward traveling (or conversely), both controlled such as the point of interest keeps its scale in the image, while its environment scales up or down, depending whether it is nearer or more far from the camera..."

msgid "Add a camera, place it as you like for the beginning of the transtrav (your \"key\" object should be more or less at the center of the picture, it's easier to handle!). As we are going to do a \"forward\" transtrav, you should use a quite long lens at start. Go to frame ``10``, and insert a keyframe for both the location (and optionally the rotation) of the camera and its focal length."
