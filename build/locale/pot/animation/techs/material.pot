msgid "Create Fcurves for *R*, *G* and *B*, with a few random control points, all in the ``[0.0, 1.0]`` range. Manage to have three different length between the first and last keyframes, and enable the *Cyclic* extend mode (:kbd:`E-Numpad2`). This way, with the three curves cycling over various periods, you'll get a never-the-same color animation! Unless you want to get a \"time-tileable\" animation, in which case you should manage to get exactly the same color at start and end... You can also create an *Emit* Fcurve, e.g. to create a fade in/out..."
