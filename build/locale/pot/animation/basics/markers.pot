msgid "Markers are used to denote frames at which something significant happens - it could be that a character's animation starts, the camera changes position, or a door opens, for example. Markers can be given names to make them more meaningful at a quick glance. They are available in many of Blender's windows, under different forms. Unlike the keyframes, markers are always placed at a whole frame number, you cannot e.g. set a marker at \"frame ``2.5`` \"."
