msgid "The layers' main purpose is to gather sketches that are related in some meaningful way (i.e. \"blocking notes\", \"director's comments on blocking\", or \"guidelines\"). For this reason, all the strokes on a layer (not just those made after a particular change) are affected by that layer's color, opacity, and stroke thickness settings."

msgid "Use the Grease Pencil to do basic pencil tests (i.e. 2D animation in flipbook style). Sketches are stored on the frame that they were drawn on, as a separate drawing (only on the layer that they exist on). Each drawing is visible until the next drawing for that layer is encountered. The only exception to this is the first drawing for a layer, which will also be visible before the frame it was drawn on."
