msgid "3D scenes often become exponentially more confusing as they grow more complex. Sometimes the artist also needs precise control over how individual objects are lit, and does not want lights for one object to affect nearby objects. For this and other reasons below, objects can be placed into one or more \"layers\". Using object layers, you can:"

msgid "Armatures can also become very complex, with different types of bones, controllers, solvers, custom shapes, and so on. Since armatures are usually located close together, this can quickly become cluttered. Therefore, Blender also provides layers just for armatures. Armature layers are very similar to object layers, in that you can divide up an armature (rig) across layers and only display those layers you wish to work on."
