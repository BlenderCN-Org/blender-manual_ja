msgid "Blender's Video Sequence Editor is a flexible workbench for editing your video footage. It is used to review your footage, and glue many sequences of your movie together. It offers a number of built-in and plug-in effects to transition from sequence to sequence, providing advanced hollywood-style effects for a professional looking video."

Each channel is numbered on the left-hand side, starting from 0 (you can't put anything thing in this special one!) and going up. Stripes toward the bottom are more dominant, which we'll get to in a minute. In the x direction, seconds of animation or frames of animation (:kbd:`Ctrl-T` to choose) are used as the measure of time (seconds 1 through 7 are shown). You can scale the time using the zoom keys or mouse actions (see the Reference for more info)."

If you have a mis-match between the size of the input image and the render output size, the VSE does try to auto-scale the image to fit it entirely in the output. This may result in clipping.

When you use Crop or Offset, the auto-scaling will be disabled and you can manually re-scale by adding the Transform effect."

Unfortunately, we initially reserved 4 digits for the filename of each video image sequence set. While that provides for up to 400 seconds of video (about 5 minutes US), with Blender moving into movies, you need to break up IMAGE strips into 4 digits only, and others 5 digits (10000-19999), (20000-29999), etc. Important: that only affects IMAGE strips at the moment.
