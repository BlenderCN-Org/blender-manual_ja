The modifier strip is either a solid color or a black-and-whte mask, or another image entirely. The example to the right shows what happens when you add gray to an image, and animate the effect over time. The image gets bright because we are adding gray (R:.5, G:.5, B:.5) to say, a blue color (R.1, G:.1, B:.5) resulting in (R:.6, G:.6, B:1.0) which retains the original hue (relationship between the colors) but is much brighter (has a higher value).

If you notice a glow around your foreground objects, or strange transparent areas of your foreground object when using AlphaOver, enable PreMultiply. The AlphaOver Drop effect is much like the Cross, but puts preference to the top or second image, giving more of a gradual overlay effect than a blend like the Cross does.

msgid "You can use the speed control to change the frames per second (fps), or framerate, of a video. If you are rendering your video to a sequence set, you can effectively increase or decrease the number of individual image files created, by using a Global Speed value less than or greater than one, respectively. For example, if you captured a five-minute video at 30 fps and wanted to transfer that to film, which runs at 24 fps, you would enter a Global Speed of 30/24, or 1.25 (and Enable Frame Blending to give that film blur feel). Instead of producing 5*60*30=9000 frames, Blender would produce 9000/1.25=7200=5*60*24 frames. In this case, you set a Sta:1 and End:7200, set your Format output to Jpeg, 30fps, and image files 0001.jpg through 7200.jpg would be rendered out, but those images 'cover' the entire 9000 frames. The image file 7200. jpg is the same a frame 9000. When you read those images back into your film .blend at 24 fps, the strip will last exactly 5 minutes."

There is no automatic sync feature in Blender, but you can open two viewer windows, choose one camera as the master channel and sync the other against them just by looking at the movement of legs or light flashes (depending of the show, you want to edit). We might add automatic sync feature based on global brightness of the video frames in the future. (Syncing based on the audio tracks, like most commercial applications do, isn't very clever, since the speed of sound is only around 340 metres per second and if you have one of you camera 30 meters away, which isn't uncommon, you are already 2-3 frames off. Which *is* noticeable...)"
