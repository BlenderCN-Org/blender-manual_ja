msgid "Audio-RAM loads a file into memory and plays it from there. You can only load stand-alone WAV files. Audio-HD plays the sound back from the hard disk and thus does not take up memory. With Audio HD, you can load stand-alone WAV files, but also audio tracks from movies."

msgid "For either, a green audio strip will be created. With Audio RAM, a waveform is created that shows you the waveform inside the green strip, scaled to the height of the green strip. Since Audio-RAM files are read into memory, changing the audio file will not affect playback, and you will have to re-open the file so that Blender re-reads the file."

msgid "Some audiophile users report that Hiss is introduced sometimes if Audio RAM is used. There must be some decoding or sampling going on, that does not occur when Audio HD is used, that introduces some playback noise. If you hear pops and crackles, usually that is a sign that your hardware cannot keep up in real-time playback. They will not be present in your final rendered animation output (but they may show up in Game mode)."

You can make a curve by having multiple points, to vary the volume over its length. Press :kbd:`Tab` to edit the curve, just like any old bezier F-curve."

msgid "Animating an audio strip affects the volume of the strip in the resulting composite. Use animation on an audio strip to fade in/out background music or to adjust volume levels. Layered/crossed audio strips are added together; the lower channel does not override and cut out higher channels. This makes Blender an audio mixer. By adding audio tracks and using the curves to adjust each tracks' sound level, you have an automated dynamic multi-track audio mixer!"

An audio file may be created via the *MIXDOWN* button in the *Sequencer* button of the Scene Context, Sound Sub-context. This WAV file contains the full audio sequence and is created in the same directory of the video file and with the *same name* but with a ``.wav`` extension. You can mix Video and Audio later on with an external program or by adding it to, for example, an image sequence strip as described above."
