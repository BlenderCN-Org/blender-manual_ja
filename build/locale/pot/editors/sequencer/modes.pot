There are as many curves as scanlines in the frame: each one of this curves represents the luminosity of the pixels of one line. Moreover, the color of a pixel in this mode represents the number of pixels from the matching column of the frame sharing the same luminosity - i.e. the number of curves that cross at this point (black/transparent, for no pixel, white/opaque for at least 3 pixels)."
