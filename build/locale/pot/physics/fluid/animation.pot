msgid "A new type of Ipo Curve, *FluidSim*, is available for fluid domain objects. Unlike most other animatable values in Blender, *FluidSim* Ipos cannot be keyframed by simply using the :kbd:`I` key; you must manually set values by clicking in the Ipo window. In order to set a keyframe, you must select the property you wish to animate in the Ipo window and :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` click to set the keyframe to the desired location in the Ipo window."

msgid "Changes the speed of the simulation; like the Speed Control in the VSE can speed up or slow down a video, this curve can speed up or slow down the fluid motion during a frame sequence. If the value for *Fac-Tim* is less than or equal to zero, time (and the fluid) stands still; the fluid freezes. For values between 0.0 and 1.0, the fluid runs slower and will look thicker. 1.0 is normal fluid motion, and values greater than 1.0 will make the fluid flow faster, possibly appearing thinner."

msgid "When Active transitions from 0.0 to something greater than 0 (such as between 0.1 and 1.0), the object's function (designated as an *Inflow*, or *Outflow*, etc.) resumes its effect. Crossing down to 0.0 and then at some point, back up, re-establishes the effect and the resulting fluid sim. Use this for dripping, or any kind of intermittent inflow. This active status also works for objects designated as *Outflow* and *Obstacle*, so you can also simulate (for example) a drain plugging up."
