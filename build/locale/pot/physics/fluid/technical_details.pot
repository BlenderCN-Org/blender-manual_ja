msgid "Fluid animation can take a lot of time - the better you understand how it works, the easier it will be to estimate how the results will look. The algorithm used for Blender's fluid simulation is the *Lattice Boltzmann Method* (LBM); other fluid algorithms include *Navier-Stokes* (NS) solvers and *Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics* (SPH) methods. LBM lies somewhere between these two."

msgid "The viscosity of water is already really low, so especially for small resolutions, the turbulence of water can not be correctly captured. If you look closely, most simulations of fluids in computer graphics do not yet look like real water as of now. Generally, don't rely on the physical settings too much (such as physical domain size or length of the animation in seconds). Rather try to get the overall motion right with a low resolution, and then increase the resolution as much as possible or desired."

msgid "The integration of the fluid simulator was done as a Google Summer-of-Code project. More information about the solver can be found at `www.ntoken.com <http://graphics.ethz.ch/~thuereyn/ntoken3/Publications.html>`__. These Animations were created with the solver before its integration into blender: `Adaptive Grids <http://www10.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~sinithue/public/phd/nthuerey_050731_sgposter.avi>`__, `Interactive Animations <http://www10.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~sinithue/public/phd/nthuerey_050607_tr1rtlbm.avi>`__. Thanks to Chris Want for organizing the Blender-SoC projects, and to Jonathan Merrit for mentoring this one! And of course thanks to Google for starting the whole thing... SoC progress updates were posted here: `SoC-Blenderfluid-Blog at PlanetSoC <http://www.planetsoc.com/blog/51>`__."
