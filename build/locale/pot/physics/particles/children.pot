msgid "*Children* are *Hair* and *Keyed* particles assigned subparticles. They make it possible to work primarily with a relatively low amount of Parent particles, for whom the physics are calculated. The children are then aligned to their parents. Without recalculating the physics the number and visualization of the children can be changed."

msgid "Children can be emitted from particles or from faces (with some different options). Emission from *Faces* has some advantages, especially the distribution is more even on each face (which makes it better suitable for fur and the like). However, children from particles follow their parents better, e.g. if you have a softbody animation and don't want the hair to penetrate the emitting mesh. But see also our manual page about :doc:`Hair </physics/particles/hair>`."
