msgid "*Emitter* systems use a unified system for caching and baking (together with softbody and cloth). The results of the simulation are automatically cached to disk when the animation is played, so that the next time it runs, it can play again quickly by reading in the results from the disk. If you *Bake* the simulation the cache is protected and you will be asked when you're trying to change a setting that will make a recalculating necessary."

msgid "As animation is played, each physics system writes each frame to disk, between the simulation start and end frames. These files are stored in folders with prefix ``blendcache``, next to the ``.blend`` file. Note that for the cache to fill up, one has to start playback before or on the frame that the simulation starts."
