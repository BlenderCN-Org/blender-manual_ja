# 0c520419d18e47e8b5ab36574a516c09
msgid "Also known as \"Forward Euler\". Simplest integrator. Very fast but also with less exact results. If no dampening is used, particles get more and more energy over time. For example, bouncing particles will bounce higher and higher each time. Should not be confused with \"Backward Euler\" (not implemented) which has the opposite feature, energies decrease over time, even with no dampening. Use this integrator for short simulations or simulations with a lot of dampening where speedy calculations is more important than accuracy."

It should be noted that in example of the bouncing particles, the particles might bounce higher than they started once in a while, but this is not a trend. This integrator is a generally good integrator for use in most cases. +"
