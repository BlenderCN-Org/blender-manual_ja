msgid "The particle paths of keyed particles are determined from the emitter to another particle system's particles. This allows creation of chains of systems with keyed physics to create long strands or groovy moving particles. Basically the particles have no dynamics but are interpolated from one system to the next at drawtime. Because you have so much control over these kind of systems, you may use it"

msgid "For example, for machines handling fibers (animation of a loom, ...). In (Image 3), the strands flow from the bottom system (First keyed) to the second keyed system in the middle, and from that to the top system that has None-Physics. Since you may animate each emitter object as you like, you can do arbitrarily complex animations."

If you have more than one keyed system in a chain, the lifetime will be split equally. This may lead to varying particle speeds between the targets."

msgid "An example: let's assume that you have two keyed systems in a chain and a third system as target. The particle lifetime of the first system shall be 50 keys. The particles will travel in 25 frames from the first keyed system to the second, and in further 25 frames from the second system to the target. If you use the Timed button for the first system, the Time slider appears in the second systems panel. It's default value is 0.5, so the time is equally split between the systems. If you set Time to 1, the movement from the first system to the second will get all the lifetime (the particles will die at the second system)."
