msgid "There are two different collision types that you may use: collision between different objects and internal collision. We should set one thing straight from the start: the primary targets of the collision calculation are the vertices of a Soft Body. So if you have too few vertices too few collision takes place. Secondarily, you can use edges and faces to improve the collision calculation."

msgid "A cube colliding with a plane works pretty well (*Image 2a*), but a plane falls right through a cube that it is supposed to collide with (*Image 2b*). Why is that? Because the default method of calculation only checks to see if the four vertices of the plane collides with the cube as the plane is pulled down by gravity. You can activate *CFace* to enable collision between the face of the plane and the object instead (*Image 2c*), but this type of calculation takes much longer."

The position that a vertex finally ends up in is dependent on the forces that act upon it. In the example gravity and the repulsion force of the face balance out. The speed at which the vertex is pulled out of the collision zone is influenced by the *Choke* parameter (*Image 4*)."

The two on the far right (5 and 6) are traveling so fast that they pass right through the collision zone (this is because of the default solver precision - which we can fix later). You will notice that the fourth vertex also travels quite fast and because it is heavier it breaches the inner zone. The first three vertices collide OK."
