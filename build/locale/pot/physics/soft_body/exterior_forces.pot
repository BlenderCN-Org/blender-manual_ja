The object does not deform, because every vertex moves with the same speed in the same direction."

The force scales with the projection of the relative speed on the edge (dot product). Note that the force is the same if wind is blowing or if you drag the edge through the air with the same speed. That means that an edge moving in its own direction feels no force, and an edge moving perpendicular to its own direction feels maximum force."
