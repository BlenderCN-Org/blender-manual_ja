msgid "Cloth simulation is one of the hardest aspects of CG, because it is a deceptively simple real-world item that is taken for granted, yet actually has very complex internal and environmental interactions. After years of development, Blender has a very robust cloth simulator that is used to make clothing, flags, banners, and so on. Cloth interacts with and is affected by other moving objects, the wind and other forces, as well as a general aerodynamic model, all of which is under your control."

msgid "A piece of cloth is any mesh, open or enclosed, that has been designated as cloth. The *Cloth* panels are located in the *Physics* sub-context and consist of three panels of options. Cloth is either an open or closed mesh and is mass-less, in that all cloth is assumed to have the same density, or mass per square unit."

msgid "Cloth is commonly modeled as a mesh grid primitive, or a cube, but can also be, for example, a teddy bear. However, Blender's :doc:`Softbody system </physics/soft_body/index>` provides better simulation of closed meshes; Cloth is a specialized simulation of fabrics."

As a :doc:`modifier </modifiers/index>` then, it can interact with other modifiers, such as *Armature* and *Smooth*. In these cases, the ultimate shape of the mesh is computed in accordance with the order of the modifier stack. For example, you should smooth the cloth *after* the modifier computes the shape of the cloth."
