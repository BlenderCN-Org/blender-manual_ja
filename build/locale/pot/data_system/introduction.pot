msgid "Many datablocks can be shared among other datablocks - re-use is encouraged. For example, suppose you have a material for one object, named ``Glossy``. You can select a second object, for example, one that does not have a material yet. Instead of clicking *ADD NEW* for the material, click the little up-down arrow next to the *ADD NEW*, which brings up a list of existing materials. Select ``Glossy``. Now, these two objects share the same material. You will notice a \"2\" next to the name of the material, indicating that there are two users (the two objects) for this material. Other common examples include:"

msgid "Remember that Blender does not save datablocks that are not linked to anything in the *current* file. If you're building a ``.blend`` file to serve as a library of things that you intend to link-to from *other* files, you'll need to make sure that they don't accidentally get deleted from the current (the library) file. Do this by giving the datablocks a \"fake user\", by pressing the *F* button next to the name of the datablock. This prevents the user count from ever becoming zero: therefore, the datablock will not be deleted. (Blender does not keep track of how many other files link to this one.)"

This is possible by first selecting objects you want to link or copy and then using the *Make Links* and *Make Single User* items found in *Object* menu in the 3D viewport header. Use *Make Links* to make links between scenes. To make a plain copy, you first make a link and then use *Make Single User* to make a stand-alone copy of the object in your current scene. Further information on working with scenes can be found :doc:`here </data_system/scenes>`."
