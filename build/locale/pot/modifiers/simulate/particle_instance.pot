msgid "Because of the co-dependant way in which the *ParticleInstance* modifier is influenced by the underlying particle systems on other objects, some of the apparent effects generated by the *ParticleInstance* modifier can look and act vastly different, depending on the underlying settings of the particle systems it is associated with. This is worth taking account of if the *ParticleInstance* modifier settings don't appear to be giving the results expected, as it may indicate that the particle system settings may need altering rather than the *ParticleInstance* modifier settings."

msgid "The *Object* field, associates this *ParticleInstance* modifier with another object (usually an object having a particle system...). This indicates that when the object named in this field emits particles, those particles will have the mesh shape of the current *ParticleInstance* modifier's mesh. If for example a sphere has a *ParticleInstance* modifier added to it, when the *Object* field of this modifier is filled in with the name of an object that emits particles, those particle will be sphere shaped. Even though most of the time the *Object* field will have the name of an object with a particle system, this is not mandatory, you can enter an object's name which does not have a particle system, and it will be accepted by the *Object* field, as there do not appear to be any checks made to make sure the object's name entered into this field is \"valid\"."

It is possible to select any of the ten particle system numbers, however a check will **not** be made with the underlying particle emitting object specified previously in the *Object* field. If you select a particle system number which does not exist on the particle emitting object, then the particles on the emitting mesh will keep their normal particle shapes - no warning will be given that the chosen particle system does not exist on a particular particle emitting mesh."
