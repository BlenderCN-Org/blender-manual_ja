msgid "With ``.zip`` you have to manually copy and extract Blender to the desired folder, where you can then double-click the executable to run Blender. There is no installer to place Blender on the menu, but there is also no need for Administrator rights. With this option it is possible to have multiple versions of Blender without conflicting, as they are not actually installed on the system."
