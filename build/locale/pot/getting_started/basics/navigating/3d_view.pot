msgid "Our eye is used to perspective viewing because distant objects appear smaller. Orthographic projection often seems a bit odd at first, because objects stay the same size regardless of their distance. It is like viewing the scene from an infinitely distant point. Nevertheless, orthographic viewing is very useful (it is the default in Blender and most other 3D applications), because it provides a more \"technical\" insight into the scene, making it easier to draw and judge proportions."

msgid "A *perspective* view is geometrically constructed by taking a scene in 3D and placing an observer at point ``O``. The 2D perspective scene is built by placing a plane (e.g. a sheet of paper) where the 2D scene is to be drawn in front of point ``O``, perpendicular to the viewing direction. For each point ``P`` in the 3D scene a ``PO`` line is drawn, passing by ``O`` and ``P``. The intersection point ``S`` between this ``PO`` line and the plane is the perspective projection of that point. By projecting all points ``P`` of the scene you get a perspective view."

msgid "Toggling Quad View will split the 3D window into 4 views: 3 *Ortho* views and a *Camera* / *User View*. This view will allow you to instantly see your model from a number of view points. In this arrangement, you can zoom and pan each view independently but you cannot rotate the view. Note that this is different from splitting the windows and aligning the view manually. In Quad View, the four views are still part of a single 3D window. So they share the same draw options and layers."
