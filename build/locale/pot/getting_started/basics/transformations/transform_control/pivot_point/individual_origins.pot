msgid "The Origin of an Object is shown in the 3D view by a small orange circle. This is highlighted in the image to the right by the red arrow. The origin tells Blender *where that Object is in 3D space*. What you see in the 3D view (vertices, edges etc) is what makes up the Object."

msgid "While the Origin is equivalent to the center of the *Object*, it does not have to be located in the center of the *Mesh*. This means that an Object can have its center located on one end of the mesh or even completely outside the mesh. For example, the orange rectangle in the image has its Origin located on the far left of the mesh."

msgid "In Edit mode, setting the Pivot Point to Individual Origins produces different results when the selection mode is set to Vertex, Edge or Face. For example, Vertex mode produces results similar to setting the pivot point to median and Edge mode often produces distorted results. Using Individual Origins in Face mode produces the most predictable results."
