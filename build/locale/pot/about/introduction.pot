msgid "The Blender manual maintainers are divided into administrators, section owners, section members and contributors. Before you can edit the documentation directly, you need to submit patches for review, similarly to how Blender's own development process works. Straight-forward patches are bound to be accepted very quickly and once you get accustomed to making changes and no longer need feedback, you will gain commit access."

msgid "Communication is a very important step of community development. Before you make any edits that are not simple and plainly justified (for example, moving folders around), you should verify with a manual maintainer that your contribution is along the community's vision for the manual. This ensures best use of your time and good will as it is otherwise possible that, for some reason, your changes will conflict and be rejected or need time-consuming review. For example, another person may be already working on the section you wish to change, the section may be scheduled for deletion or to be updated according to a planned change to Blender."
