msgid "The `Simple Motion`_ actuator gives control over position and velocity, but does this as an instant displacement; the object never passes any of the coordinates between the start and end positions. This can interfere with the physical simulation of other objects, and can cause an object to go through another object. The `Servo Control`_ actuator does not suffer from this, since it produces physically correct velocities, and leaves updating the position to the physics simulation."

msgid "This controls the reaction to the sum of errors so far. Using only the Proportional component results in a systematic velocity error if there is friction: some velocity delta is necessary to produce the force that compensates the friction. Using the Integral component suppresses this effect (the target velocity is achieved on average) but can create oscillations; the control will speed to compensate the initial velocity error. To avoid the oscillation, the Proportional component must be used with the Integral component (the Proportional component damps the control) This is why the GUI sets the Proportional Coefficient systematically when you change the Integral Coefficient."
