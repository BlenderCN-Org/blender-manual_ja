msgid "You set up two *Collision* sensors, one for enemy bullets, and one for picking up more health. The first one is connected (through an *AND* controller) to an *Add Property* actuator with the property hp and the value -10. Every time the player is hit by an enemy bullet he loses 10 hp. The other sensor is connected (through an *AND* controller) to an other *Add Property* actuator, this one with the value 50. So every time the player collides with a health item the hp increases by 50. Next you set up a *Property* sensor for an interval, greater than 100. This is connected (through an *AND* controller) to an *Assign Property* actuator which is set to 100. So if the players hp increases over 100 it is set to 100."
