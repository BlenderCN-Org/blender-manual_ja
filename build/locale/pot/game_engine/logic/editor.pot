msgid "The Logic Editor provides the main method of setting up and editing the game logic for the various actors (i.e. objects) that make up the game. The logic for the objects which are currently selected in the associated 3D panel are displayed as logic bricks, which are shown as a table with three columns, showing sensors, controllers, and actuators, respectively. The links joining the logic bricks conduct the pulses between sensor-controller and controller-actuator."

Several types of properties are available. Properties are declared by clicking the Add Game Property button in this area.

Links can only be drawn from Sensors to Controllers, or from Controllers to Actuators. You cannot directly link Sensors to Actuators; likewise, Actuators cannot be linked back to Sensors (however special actuator and sensor types are available to provide these connections)."
