msgid "A word of warning, before you start any big or serious project with the Blender Game Engine, you should note that it is currently not very supported and that there are plans for its retargeting and refactoring that, in the very least, will break compatibility. For further information, you should get in touch with the developers via mailing list or IRC and read the `development roadmap <http://code.blender.org/index.php/2013/06/blender-roadmap-2-7-2-8-and-beyond/>`__."

msgid "Blender has its own built in Game Engine that allows you to create interactive 3D applications or simulations. The major difference between Game Engine and the conventional Blender system is in the rendering process. In the normal Blender engine, images and animations are built off-line - once rendered they cannot be modified. Conversely, the Blender Game Engine renders scenes continuously in real-time, and incorporates facilities for user interaction during the rendering process."

The :doc:`Logic Editor </game_engine/logic/editor>` provides deep interaction with the simulation, and its functionality can be extended through Python scripting. It is designed to abstract the complex engine features into a simple user interface, which does not require experience with Programming. An overview of the :doc:`Logic Editor </game_engine/logic/editor>` can be found in the :doc:`Game Logic Screen Layout </game_engine/screen_layout>`"
