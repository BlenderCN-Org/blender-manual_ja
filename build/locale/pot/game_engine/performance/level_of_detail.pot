msgid "When creating visual assets it is often desirable to have a high amount of detail in the asset for up close viewing. However, this high amount of detail is wasted if the object is viewed from a distance, and brings down the scene's performance. To solve this, the asset can be swapped out at certain viewing distances. This is commonly referred to as a level of detail system. Each visual step of the asset is known as a level of detail. Levels of detail are most appropriate to use when you have a large scene where certain objects can be viewed both up close and from a distance."

In the Levels of Detail panel is a button to add a new level of detail to the current object. The settings for each level of detail is displayed in its own box. The exception to this is the base level of detail. This is automatically setup as the current object with a distance setting of 0. To remove a level of detail, click on the X button in the top right corner of the box of the level to be removed."

The selected object must be the base level of detail (e.g. LOD0). This can be useful to quickly setup levels of detail on imported assets. In order to make use of this tool, your naming must be consistent, and each level must be prefixed or suffixed with \"lodx\" where x is the level that object is intended for. The case on \"lod\" must be consistent across all objects. Below are some example names that the tool will recognize."
