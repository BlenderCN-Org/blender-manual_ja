msgid "The Game Engine camera is in many ways similar to the Camera in the normal Blender Render system, and is created, parameterized and manipulated in similar ways. However because of its use as a real-time device, the Game Engine camera has a number of additional features - it may be used as not only as a static camera, but also as a moving device with its default characteristics (ie. with its own programmed moves), or it may track another object in the game. Furthermore, any game object may be used as a camera; the view is taken from the object's origin point. Lastly, it may be given special capabilities such as Stereo vision, Dome visualisation etc. which have special relevance to game technology."

Thus to start the game with a particular camera, you must select the camera and press :kbd:`Numpad0` before starting the Game Engine."
