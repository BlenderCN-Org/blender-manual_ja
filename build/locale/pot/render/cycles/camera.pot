This corresponds to looking at the center of the image using the default environment texture mapping."

msgid "Fisheye lenses are typically wide angle lenses with strong distortion, useful for creating panoramic images for e.g. dome projection, or as an artistic effect. The *Fisheye Equisolid* lens will best match real cameras. It provides a lens focal length and field of view angle, and will also take the sensor dimensions into account."
