msgid "While rendering stills will allow you to view and save the image from the render buffer when it's complete, animations are a series of images, or frames, and are automatically saved directly out to disk after being rendered."

msgid "After rendering the frames, you may need to edit the clips, or first use the Compositor to do green-screen masking, matting, color correction, DOF, and so on to the images. That result is then fed to the Sequencer where the strips are cut and mixed and a final overlay is done."

msgid "Generally, you do a lot of intermediate renders of different frames in your animation to check for timing, lighting, placement, materials, and so on. At some point, you are ready to make a final render of the complete animation for publication."

# 45492d5ecf2046d9bdd20bb9e8fcf7f1
msgid "There are two approaches you can use when making a movie, or animation, with or without sound. The approach you should use depends on the amount of CPU time you will need to render the movie. You can render a \"typical\" frame at the desired resolution, and then multiply by the number of frames that will ultimately go into the movie, to arrive at an total render time."

# 547474b3b766497eac7c407faa48597a
msgid "If the total render time is an hour or more, you want to use the \"Frame Sequence\" approach. For example, if you are rendering a one-minute video clip for film, there will be (60 seconds per minute) * (24 frames per second) or 1440 frames per minute. If each frame takes 30 seconds to render, then you will be able to render two frames per minute, or need 720 minutes (12 hours) of render time."

msgid "The **Direct Approach** - highly **not** recommended and not a standard practice - is where you set your output format to an AVI or MOV format, and click ANIM to render your scene directly out to a movie file. Blender creates one file that holds all the frames of your animation. You can then use Blender's VSE to add an audio track to the animation and render out to an MPEG format to complete your movie."

#: ../../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:48
# 93823eaf0a4343bdbc9fd93438e02551
msgid "The **Frame Sequence** is a much more stable approach, where you set your output format to a still format (such as JPG, PNG or MultiLayer), and click ANIM to render your scene out to a set of images, where each image is the frame in the sequence."

msgid "Blender creates a file for each frame of the animation. You can then use Blender's compositor to perform any frame manipulation (post processing). You can then use Blender's VSE to load that final image sequence, add an audio track to the animation, and render out to an MPEG format to complete your movie. The Frame Sequence approach is a little more complicated and takes more disk space, but gives you more flexibility."
