msgid "Environment maps take a render of the 3D scene and apply it to a texture, to use for faking reflections. If you want to achieve a very realistic result, raytraced reflections are a good solution. Environment Maps are another way to create reflective surfaces, but they are not so simple to set up."

msgid "Just as we render the light that reaches the viewing plane using the camera to define a viewpoint, we can render the light that reaches the surface of an object (and hence, the light that might ultimately be reflected to the camera). Blender's environment mapping renders a cubic image map of the scene in the six cardinal directions from any point. When the six tiles of the image are mapped onto an object using the *Refl* input coordinates, they create the visual complexity that the eye expects to see from shiny reflections."

The most unbelievable thing about most rendered images is the sterility, not the inaccuracy."
