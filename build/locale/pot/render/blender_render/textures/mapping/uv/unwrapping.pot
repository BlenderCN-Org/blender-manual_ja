msgid "The first step is to unwrap your mesh. You want to unwrap when you feel your mesh is complete with respect to the number of faces it needs to have. If you do add faces or subdivide existing faces when a model is already unwrapped, Blender will add those new faces for you, but you may need to do additional mapping or editing. In this fashion, you can use the UV Texture image to guide additional geometry changes."

msgid "Each face of a mesh can have many UV Textures. Each UV Texture can have an individual image assigned to it. When you unwrap a face to a UV Texture in the UV/Image Editor, each face of the mesh is automatically assigned *four UV coordinates:* These coordinates define the way an image or a texture is mapped onto the face. These are 2D coordinates, which is why they're called UV, to distinguish them from XYZ coordinates. These coordinates can be used for rendering or for real-time OpenGL display as well."

Think of this method as peeling an orange or skinning an animal. You make a series of cuts in the skin, then peel it off. You could then flatten it out, applying some amount of stretching. These cuts are the same as seams."

msgid "When using this method, you need to be aware of how much stretching there is. The more seams there are, the less stretching there is, but this is often an issue for the texturing process. It's a good idea to have as few seams as possible while having the least amount of stretching. Try to hide seams where they will not be seen. In productions where 3d Paint is used, this becomes less of an issue, as projection painting can easily deal with seams, as opposed to 2d texturing, where it is difficult to match the edges of different UV islands."
