msgid "Painting on a 3D model requires some setup before being possible. Blender needs a way to map an image to the 3D model. This is accomplished by using a UV map (see :doc:`UV Mapping </render/blender_render/textures/mapping/uv>` for more details), so if the model hasn't been unwrapped yet, it should be unwrapped prior to entering *Texture Paint* mode. The image assigned to the UV layer is also used for painting. That means that the user should either:"
