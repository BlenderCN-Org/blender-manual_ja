msgid "Blender's animations are by default rendered as a sequence of *perfectly still* images. While great for stop-motion and time-lapses, this is unrealistic, since fast-moving objects do appear to be blurred in the direction of motion, both in a movie frame and in a photograph from a real-world camera."

msgid "Vector blur is a process done in compositing (post-render time), by rendering the scene without any blur, plus a pass that has movement information for each pixel. This information is a vector map which describes a 2d or 3d direction and magnitude. The compositor uses that data to blur each pixel in the given direction."
