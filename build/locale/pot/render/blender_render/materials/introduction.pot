msgid "A material defines the artistic qualities of the substance that an object is made of. In its simplest form, you can use materials to show the substance an object is made of, or to \"paint\" the object with different colors. Usually, the substance is represented by its surface qualities (color, shininess, reflectance, etc.) but it can also exhibit more complicated effects such as transparency, diffraction and sub-surface scattering. Typical materials might be brass, skin, glass, or linen."

msgid "The rendered image you create with Blender is a projection of the scene onto an imaginary surface called the *viewing plane*. The viewing plane is analogous to the film in a traditional camera, or the rods and cones in the human eye, except that it receives simulated light, not real light."

# e7de4b847b734f3dab826b93ec031cd4
msgid "To render an image of a scene we must first determine what light from the scene is arriving at each point on the viewing plane. The best way to answer this question is to follow a straight line (the simulated light ray) backwards through that point on the viewing plane and the focal point (the location of the camera) until it hits a renderable surface in the scene, at which point we can determine what light would strike that point."

msgid "Using the internal ray tracer, other (more advanced) phenomena could occur. In ray-traced reflections, the point of a surface struck by a light ray will return the color of its surrounding environment, according to the rate of reflection of the material (mixing the base color and the surrounding environment's) and the viewing angle."

msgid "On the other hand, in ray-traced refractions, the point of a surface struck by a light ray will return the color of its background environment, according to the rate of transparency (mixing the base color and the background environment's along with its optional filtering value) of the material and the optional index of refraction of the material, which will distort the viewing angle."

msgid "The exact effect of Material settings can be affected by a number of system settings. First and foremost is the Render Engine used - Cycles and the Blender Render Engine (aka Blender Internal or BI) require quite different illumination levels to achieve similar results, and even then the appearance of objects can be quite different. Also, the material properties settings can be affected by the texture method used (Single Texture, Multitexture or GLSL). So it is recommended to always select the appropriate system settings before starting the design of materials."
