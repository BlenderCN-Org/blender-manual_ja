msgid "Many organic and inorganic materials are not totally opaque right at the surface, so light does not just bounce off the top surface. Instead, some light also penetrates the skin surface deeply, and scatters around inside, taking on the color of the insides and emerging back out at a different location. Human/animal skin, the skin of grapes, tomatoes, fruits, wax, gels (like honey, or Jello) and so on all have subsurface scattering (SSS), and photo-realism really cannot be achieved without it."

As the light travels through the object it bounces around then emerges from the surface at some other point. This value corresponds to the average length the light travels between each bounce. The longer the path length is, the further the light is allowed to scatter. This is the main source of a material's perceived \"scatter color.\" A material like skin will have a higher red radius than green and blue. Subsurface scattering is the diffusion of light beneath the surface. You control how far the light spreads to achieve a specific result."
