msgid "Mirror reflections are computed in the Blender Render and Cycles render engines using ray tracing. (NB: Reflections are not available in the Game Engine.) Ray tracing can be used to make a material reflect its surroundings, like a mirror. The principle of ray-traced reflections is very simple: a ray is fired from the camera and travels through the scene until it encounters an object. If the first object hit by the ray is not reflective, then the ray takes the color of the object. If the object is reflective, then the ray bounces from its current location and travels up to another object, and so on, until a non-reflective object is finally met and gives the whole chain of rays its color."

msgid "Eventually, the first reflective object inherits the colors of its environment, proportional to its *Reflectivity* value. Obviously, if there are only reflective objects in the scene, then the render could last forever. This is why a mechanism for limiting the travel of a single ray is set through the *Depth* value: this parameter sets the maximum number of bounces allowed for a single ray."

msgid "The *Color Swatch* in the mirror panel is the color of the light reflected back. Usually, for normal mirrors, use white. However, some mirrors color the reflection (e.g. metals), so you can change the color by clicking on the swatch. The amount of mirrored reflection is determined by the *Reflectivity* value. If set to something greater than 0, mirrored reflectivity will be activated and the reflection will be tinted the color set in the swatch."

In order to replicate this within Blender, you have to set the Mirror Color accordingly. To set a mirror color, simply click the color swatch in the mirror panel and select a color."

Also, uneven or waxed-but-grainy surfaces (such as car paint) are not perfect and therefore slightly need a Gloss < 1.0. In the example to the right, the left mirror has a Gloss of 0.98, the middle is Gloss = 1.0, and the right one has Gloss of 0.90. Use this setting to make a realistic reflection, all the way up to a completely foggy mirror. You can also use this value to mimic depth of field in mirrors."
