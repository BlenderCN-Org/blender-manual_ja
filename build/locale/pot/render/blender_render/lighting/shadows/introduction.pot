msgid "Light wouldn't even exist without its counterpart: shadows. Shadows are a darkening of a portion of an object because light is being partially or totally blocked from illuminating the object. They add contrast and volume to a scene; there is nearly no place in the real world without shadows, so to get realistic renders, you will need them. Blender supports the following kinds of shadows:"

msgid "Ambient occlusion really isn't a shadow based on light *per se*, but based on geometry. However, it does mimic an effect where light is prevented from fully and uniformly illuminating an object, so it is mentioned here. Also, it is important to mention ambient lighting, since increasing *Ambient* decreases the effect of a shadow."
