However, there are some specifics with this lamp, which are detailed below:"

msgid "This have the same role as with other lamps, but when using a *Rectangle* *Area* lamp, you have two samples settings: *Samples X* and *Samples Y*, for the two axes of the area plane. Note also that when using the *Constant Jittered* sample generator method, this is more or less equivalent to the number of virtual lamps in the area. With QMC sample generator methods, it behaves similarly to with *Lamp* or *Spot* lamps."

It artificially softens the borders of shadows; when *Samples* is set very low, you can expect poor results, so *Dither* is better used with medium *Samples* values. It is not useful at all with high *Samples* values, as the borders will already appear soft."

msgid "You will note that changing the *Size* parameter of your area lamp doesn't affect the lighting intensity of your scene. On the other hand, rescaling the lamp using the :kbd:`S` in the 3D View could dramatically increase or decrease the lighting intensity of the scene. This behavior has been coded this way so that you can fine tune all your light settings and then decide to scale up (or down) the whole scene without suffering from a drastic change in the lighting intensity. If you only want to change the dimensions of your *Area* lamp, without messing with its lighting intensity, you are strongly encouraged to use the *Size* button(s) instead."

However, these results will never be better than the same lighting with high *Samples* values."
