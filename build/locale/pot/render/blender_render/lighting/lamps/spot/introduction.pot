msgid "The *Spot* light is the most complex of the light objects and indeed, for a long time, among the most used thanks to the fact that it was the only one able to cast shadows. Nowadays, with a ray tracer integrated into Blender's internal render engine, all lamps can cast shadows (except *Hemi*). Even so, *Spot* lamps' shadow buffers are much faster to render than ray-traced shadows, especially when blurred/softened, and spot lamps also provide other functionality such as \"volumetric\" halos."

msgid "*Buffered Shadows* are also known as depth map shadows. Shadows are created by calculating differences in the distance from the light to scene objects. See :doc:`Buffered Shadows </render/blender_render/lighting/lamps/spot/buffered_shadows>` for full details on using this feature. Buffered shadows are more complex to set up and involve more faking, but the speed of rendering is a definite advantage. Nevertheless, it shares with other lamp types common shadow options described in :doc:`Shadows Properties </render/blender_render/lighting/shadows/properties>`."
