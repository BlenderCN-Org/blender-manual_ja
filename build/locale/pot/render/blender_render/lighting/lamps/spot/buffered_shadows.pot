msgid "When using a *Spot* lamp with buffered shadows, to maintain or increase quality of generated shadows, it is helpful to adjust the *Clip Start* and *Clip End* such that their values closely bound around the areas which they want to have shadows generated at. Minimizing the range between *Clip Start* and *Clip End*, minimizes the area shadows are computed in and therefore helps increase shadow quality in the more restricted area."
