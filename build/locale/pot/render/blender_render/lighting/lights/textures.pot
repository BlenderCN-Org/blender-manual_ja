msgid "When a new lamp is added, it produces light in a uniform, flat color. While this might be sufficient in simple renderings, more sophisticated effects can be accomplished through the use of :doc:`textures </render/blender_render/textures/index>`. Subtle textures can add visual nuance to a lamp, while hard textures can be used to simulate more pronounced effects, such as a disco ball, dappled sunlight breaking through treetops, or even a projector. These textures are assigned to one of ten channels, and behave exactly like material textures, except that they affect a lamp's color and intensity, rather than a material's surface characteristics."

msgid "The lamp textures settings are grouped into two panels. Here we will only talk about the few things that differ from object material textures; see the :doc:`Materials </render/blender_render/materials/index>` and :doc:`Textures </render/blender_render/textures/index>` chapters for details about the standard options."

msgid "The texture-specific and the *Mapping* panels remain the same. However, you'll note there are much fewer *Mapping* options - you can only choose between *Global*, *View* or another *Object* 's texture *coordinates* (since a lamp has no texture coordinates by itself), and you can scale or offset the texture."

msgid "The *Mapping* panel is also a subset of its regular material's counterpart. You can only map a lamp texture to its regular, basic *Color* and/or to its *Shadow* color. As you can only affect colors, and a lamp has no texture coordinates on its own, the *Diffuse*, *Specular*, *Shading*, and *Geometry* options have disappeared."
