msgid "Ambient Occlusion is a sophisticated ray-tracing calculation which simulates soft global illumination shadows by faking darkness perceived in corners and at mesh intersections, creases, and cracks, where ambient light is occluded, or blocked."

msgid "There is no such thing as AO in real life; AO is a specific not-physically-accurate (but generally nice-looking) rendering trick. It basically samples a hemisphere around each point on the face, sees what proportion of that hemisphere is occluded by other geometry, and shades the pixel accordingly."

msgid "It's got nothing to do with light at all; it's purely a rendering trick that tends to look nice because generally in real life surfaces that are close together (like small cracks) will be darker than surfaces that don't have anything in front of them, because of shadows, dirt, etc."

In most cases, it is best to light a scene properly with Blender's standard lamps, then use AO on top of that, set to *Multiply*, for the additional details and contact shadows."
