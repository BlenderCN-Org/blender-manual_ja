msgid "\"A watched pot never boils\" is the old saying, but you may wonder why your render takes so long to create, or worse, crashes mid-way through! Well, there is lots going on and lots you can do to speed up rendering or enable a complicated render to complete. Also, it is possible to render a very complicated scene on a mediocre PC by being \"render-smart\". Here's a \"top ten\" list of things to do or not do in order to speed up rendering or even avoid crashes during scene render. Some options may decrease the quality of your render, but for draft renders you may not care."

msgid "Switch to an Orthographic camera, and render your own \"parts\" of the scene as separate images, and then paste those parts together in GIMP. An old trick in making your own panorama with a real camera is to take three or so pictures of a very wide (beach sunset) scene, where you take one picture, rotate to the right, snap another, then another, and when you get the pictures developed, you overlap them to make a very wide landscape image. Do the same in Blender: render out one shot to a file, then move the camera to look at a different area of the scene, and render that shot. Each shot will be of a smaller area and thus take in fewer polygons/faces. Be sure that when you position your camera that you snap overlapping shots, so that you can then match them up. If you don't want to use GIMP, you can use compositing nodes and the Translate node to match them up in Blender."
