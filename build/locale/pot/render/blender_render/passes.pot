msgid "When using Vector Blur instead of Motion Blur, objects in motion are blurred, but objects at rest (with respect to the camera) are not blurred. The crossover is the shadow of the object in motion. Above, we have a cube in motion across a ground plane. If we just ran the combined pass through Vector Blur, you can see the result in the lower right-hand corner; the box is blurred, but its shadow is sharply in focus, and thus the image does not look realistic."

msgid "Therefore, we need to separate out the diffuse and shadow passes from the floor by creating a \"Floor\" render layer. That render layer has Diffuse and Shadow passes enabled, and only renders the floor object (layer 2). Another render layer (\"Cube\") renders the Z and Vector passes, and only renders the cube (on layer 1). Using the Blur node, we blur the shadow pass, and then combine the diffuse and blurred shadow by multiplying them together in a Mix Multiply node; we then have a blurred shadow on a crisp ground plane. We can then mix the vector-blurred object to provide a realistic-looking image."

msgid "Render Passes can be manipulated to give you almost complete control over your final image. Causing objects to cast shadows that aren't really their shadows, making objects appear out of focus or sharply in focus like a real camera, manipulating colors just for final post-processing or just reconfiguring your render passes to save render time, are all things which you might wish to manipulate the render engine for."
