msgid "Both material and composite nodes can be grouped. Grouping nodes can simplify the node network layout in the node editor, making your material or composite 'noodle' (node network) easier to work with. Grouping nodes also creates what are called NodeGroups (inside a .blend file) or NodeTrees (when appending)."

msgid "Conceptually, \"grouping\" allows you to specify a *set* of nodes that you can treat as though it were \"just one node\". You can then re-use it one or more times in this or some other .blend file(s)."

msgid "As an example:  If you have created a material using nodes that you would like to use in another .blend file, you *could* simply append the material from one .blend file to another. However, what if you would like to create a new material, and use a branch from an existing material node network? You could re-create the branch. Or you could append the material to the new .blend file, then cut and paste the branch that you want into the new material. Both of these options work, but are not very efficient when working across different .blend files. A better method of re-use, for either material node branches or composite node networks, would be to create groups of nodes."

msgid "To create a node group, in the node editor, select the nodes you want to include, then press :kbd:`Ctrl-G` or :menuselection:`Group --> Make Group` (:kbd:`Shift-A`). A node group will have a green title bar. All of the selected nodes will now be contained within the group node. Default naming for the node group is *NodeGroup,* *NodeGroup.001* etc. There is a name field in the node group you can click into to change the name of the group. Change the name of the node group to something meaningful. When appending node groups from one .blend file to another, Blender does not make a distinction between material node groups or composite node groups, so it's recommended some naming convention that will allow you to easily distinguish between the two types."

You can move them around, play with their individual controls, re-thread them internally, etc. just like you can if they were a normal part of your editor window. You will not be able, though, to thread them to a node outside the group; you have to use the external sockets on the side of the group node. To add or remove nodes from the group, you need to ungroup them."
