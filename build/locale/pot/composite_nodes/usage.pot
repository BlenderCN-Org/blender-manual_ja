msgid "In general, try to arrange your nodes within the window such that the image flows from left to right, top to bottom. Move a node by clicking on a benign area and drag it around. Nodes can be clicked almost anywhere and dragged about; connections will reshape as a bezier curve as best as possible."

msgid "When you duplicate a node, the new node will be positioned *exactly* on top of the node that was duplicated. If you leave it there (and it's quite easy to do so), you can **not** easily tell that there are *two* nodes there! When in doubt, grab a node and move it slightly to see if something's lurking underneath."
