msgid "This node blurs individual color channels. The color channel (or a black and white image) is connected to the *Mask* input socket, and the *Distance* is set manually (by clicking on the arrows or the value) or automatically from a value node or a time-and-map-value noodle. A positive value of *Distance* expands the influence of a pixel on its surrounding pixels, thus blurring that color outward. A negative value erodes its influence, thus increases the constrast of that pixel relative to its surrounding pixels, thus sharpening it relative to surrounding pixels of the same color."

msgid "In the above example image, we wanted to take the rather boring array of ball bearings and spruce it up; make it hot, baby. So, we dilated the red and eroded the green, leaving the blue alone. If we had dilated both red and green...(hint: red and green make yellow). The amount of influence is increased by increasing the *Distance* values. `Blend file available here. <http://wiki.blender.org/uploads/5/51/Derotest.blend>`__"
