msgid "Use this to limit the amount of blur of the most out of focus parts of the image. The value is the maximum blur radius allowed. This can be useful since the actual blur process can sometimes be very slow. (The more blur, the slower it gets.) So, setting this value can help bring down processing times, like for instance when the world background is visible, which in general tends to be the point of maximum blur (not always true, objects very close to the lens might be blurred even more). The default value of 0 means there is no limit to the maximum blur amount."

msgid "The defocus node is not perfect: some artifacts may occur. One such example is in-focus objects against a blurred background, which have a tendency to bleed into the edges of the sharp object. The worst-case scenario is an object in-focus against the very distant world background: the differences in distance are very large and the result can look quite bad. The node tries to prevent this from occurring by testing that the blur difference between pixels is not too large, the value set here controls how large that blur difference may be to consider it 'safe.' This is all probably quite confusing, and fortunately, in general, there is no need to change the default setting of 1. Only try changing it if you experience problems around any in-focus object."

msgid "As already mentioned, processing can take a long time. So to help make editing parameters somewhat 'interactive', there is a preview mode which you can enable with this button. Preview mode will render the result using a limited amount of (quasi)random samples, which is a *lot* faster than the 'perfect' mode used otherwise. The sampling mode also tends to produce grainy, noisy pictures (though the more samples you use, the less noisy the result). This option is on by default. Play around with the other parameters until you are happy with the results, and only then disable the preview mode for the final render."

# 6afd6962167d4512972eaea81ece7b81
msgid "Sometimes you might want to have more control to blur the image. For instance, you may want to only blur one object while leaving everything else alone (or the other way around), or you want to blur the whole image uniformly all at once. The node therefore allows you to use something other than an actual zbuffer as the *Z* input. For instance, you could connect an image node and use a grayscale image where the color designates how much to blur the image at that point, where white is maximum blur and black is no blur. Or, you could use a Time node to uniformly blur the image, where the time value controls the maximum blur for that frame. It may also be used to obtain a possibly slightly-better DoF blur, by using a fake depth shaded image instead of a zbuffer. (A typical method to create the fake depth shaded image is by using a linear blend texture for all objects in the scene or by using the 'fog/mist' fake depth shading method.) This also has the advantage that the fake depth image can have anti-aliasing, which is not possible with a real zbuffer. *No zbuffer* will be enabled automatically whenever you connect a node that is not image based (e.g. time node/value node/etc)."

msgid "Only visible when *No zbuffer* enabled. When *No zbuffer* is used, the input is used directly to control the blur radius. And since usually the value of a texture is only in the numeric range 0.0 to 1.0, its range is too narrow to control the blur properly. This parameter can be used to expand the range of the input (or for that matter, narrow it as well, by setting it to a value less than one). So for *No zbuffer*, this parameter therefore then becomes the main blur control (similar to *fStop* when you *do* use a zbuffer)."

In the real world, using shallow depth of field, it is not impossible for nearby objects to become completely invisible, in effect allowing the camera to see 'behind' it. Hollywood cinematographers use this visual characteristic to good effect to achieve the popular \"focus pull\" effect, where the focus shifts from a nearby to a distant object, such that the \"other\" object all but disappears.
