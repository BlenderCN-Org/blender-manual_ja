msgid "Sun Beams is a 2D effect for simulating the effect of bright light getting scattered in a medium `(Crepuscular Rays) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular_rays>`__. This phenomenon can be created by renderers, but full volumetric lighting is a rather arduous approach and takes a lot of render time. Also when working with 2D images only the volumetric data may not be available. In these cases the \"Sun Beams\" node provides a computationally cheap way of creating a convincing effect based on image brightness alone."

msgid "After generating the sun beams from such a light source image they can then be overlayed on the original image. Usually a simple \"Add\" mix node is sufficient, and physically correct because the scattered light adds to the final result."
