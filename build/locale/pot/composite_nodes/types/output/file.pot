msgid "This node puts out an RGBA image, in the format selected, for each frame range specified, to the filename entered, as part of a frameset sequence. This means that the name of the file will be the name you enter plus a numeric frame number, plus the filename extension (based on format). Based on the format you choose, various quality/compression options may be shown."

msgid "To support subsequent arrangement and layering of images, the node can supply a Z-depth map. However, please note that only the OpenEXR image formats save the Z information."

msgid "This node saves you from doing (or forgetting to do) the Save Image after a render; the image is saved automagically for you. In addition, since this node can be hooked in anywhere in the noodle, you can save intermediate images automatically. Neat, huh?"
