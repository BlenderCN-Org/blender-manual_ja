msgid "This is not, and is not intended to be, a general-purpose solution to the problem of compositing an image that doesn't contain Alpha information. You might wish to use \"Chroma Keying\" or \"Difference Keying\" (as discussed elsewhere) if you can. This node is most often used (with a suitable input being provided by means of the socket) in those troublesome cases when you *can't,* for some reason, use those techniques directly."

msgid "To transition the audience from one scene or shot to another, a common technique is to \"fade to black\". As its name implies, the scene fades to a black screen. You can also \"fade to white' or whatever color you wish, but black is a good neutral color that is easy on the eyes and intellectually \"resets\" the viewer's mind. The node map below shows how to do this using the Set Alpha node."

msgid "In the example above, the alpha channel of the swirl image is ignored. Instead, a :doc:`time node </composite_nodes/types/input/time>` introduces a factor from 0.00 to 1.00 over 60 frames, or about 2 seconds, to the Set Alpha node. Note that the time curve is exponentially-shaped, so that the overall blackness will fade in slowly and then accelerate toward the end. The Set Alpha node does not need an input image; instead the flat (shadeless) black color is used. The Set Alpha Node uses the input factor and color to create a black image that has an alpha set which goes from 0.00 to 1.00 over 60 frames, or completely transparent to completely opaque. Think of alpha as a multiplier for how vivid you can see that pixel. These two images are combined by our trusty AlphaOver node completely (a *Fac* tor of 1.00) to produce the composite image. The SetAlpha node will thus, depending on the frame being rendered, produce a black image that has some degree of transparency. Set up and Animate, and you have an image sequence that fades to black over a 2-second period."

msgid "In the above example, a Time curve provides the Alpha value to the input socket. The current RenderLayer, which has the title in view, provides the image. As before, the trusty AlphaOver node mixes (using the alpha values) the background swirl and the alphaed title to produce the composite image. Notice the *ConvertPre* -Multiply button is NOT enabled; this produces a composite where the title lets the background image show through where even the background image is transparent, allowing you to layer images on top of one another."
