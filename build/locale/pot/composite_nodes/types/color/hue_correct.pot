msgid "By default, the curve is a straight line, meaning there is no change. The spectrum allows you to raise or lower HSV levels for each range of pixel colors. To change a H, S, or V level, move the curve points up or down. Pixels with hue values each point in the horizontal position of the graph will be changed depending on the shape of the curve."
