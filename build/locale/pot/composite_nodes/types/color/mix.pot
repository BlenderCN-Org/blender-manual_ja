msgid "This node mixes a base image (threaded to the top socket) together with a second image (bottom socket) by working on the individual and corresponding pixels in the two images or surfaces. The way the output image is produced is selected in the drop-down menu. The size (output resolution) of the image produced by the mix node is the size of the base image. The alpha and Z channels are mixed as well."

msgid "As you can hopefully see, our original magic monkey was overexposed by too much light. To cure an overexposure, you must both darken the image and enhance the contrast. Other paint programs usually provide a slider type of control, but Blender, ah the fantastic Blender, provides a user-definable curve to provide precise control."

msgid "In the top RGB curve, *Darken*, only the right side of the curve was lowered; thus, any X input along the bottom results in a geometrically less Y output. The *Enhance Contrast* RGB 'S' curve scales the output such that middle values of X change dramatically; namely, the middle brightness scale is expanded, and thus whiter whites and blacker blacks are output. To make this curve, simply click on the curve and a new control point is added. Drag the point around to bend the curve as you wish. The Mix node combines these two effects equally, and Suzanne feels much better. And NOBODY wants a cranky monkey on their hands."

msgid "In the old days, a pattern was pressed into the paper mush as it dried, creating a mark that identified who made the paper and where it came from. The mark was barely perceptible except in just the right light. Probably the first form of subliminal advertising. Nowadays, people watermark their images to identify them as personal intellectual property, for subliminal advertising of the author or hosting service, or simply to track their image's proliferation throughout the web. Blender provides a complete set of tools for you to both encode your watermark and to tell if an image has your watermark."

msgid "First, construct your own personal watermark. You can use your name, a word, or a shape or image not easily replicated. While neutral gray works best using the encoding method suggested, you are free to use other colors or patterns. It can be a single pixel or a whole gradient; it's up to you. In the example below, we are encoding the watermark in a specific location in the image using the Translate node; this helps later because we only have to look in a specific location for the mark. We then use the RGB to BW node to convert the image to numbers that the Map Value node can use to make the image subliminal. In this case, it reduces the mark to one-tenth of its original intensity. The Add node adds the corresponding pixels, make the ones containing the mark ever-so-slightly brighter."

Use them while changing Blender's image format settings, reloading the watermarked image after saving, to get an acceptable result. In the example above, the mark was clearly visible all the way up to JPEG compression of 50%."

msgid "Use the dodge and burn mix methods in combination with a mask to affect only certain areas of the image. In the old darkroom days, when, yes, I actually spent hours in a small stinky room bathed in soft red light, I used a circle cutout taped to a straw to dodge areas of the photo as the exposure was made, casting a shadow on the plate and thus limiting the light to a certain area."

msgid "To do the opposite, I would burn in an image by holding a mask over the image. The mask had a hole in it, letting light through and thus 'burning' in the image onto the paper. The same equivalent can be used here by mixing an alpha mask image with your image using a dodge mixer to lighten an area of your photo. Remember that black is zero (no) effect, and white is one (full) effect. And by the way, ya grew to like the smell of the fixer, and with a little soft music in the background and the sound of the running water, it was very relaxing. I kinda miss those dayz."
