msgid "In this example, the White Level is set to the color of a bright spot of the sand in the background, and the Black Level to the color in the center of the fish's eye. To do this efficiently it's best to bring up an image viewer window showing the original input image. You can then use the levels' color picker to easily choose the appropriate colors from the input image, zooming in to pixel level if necessary. The result can be fine-tuned with the R,G, and B curves like in the previous example."
