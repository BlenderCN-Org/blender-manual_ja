msgid "As an alternative to RGB editing, color can be thought of as a mix of Hues, namely a normalized value along the visible spectrum from infra-red to ultraviolet (the rainbow, remember \"Roy G. Biv\"). The amount of the color added depends on the saturation of that color; the higher the saturation, the more of that pigment is added. Use the saturation slider of this node to \"bring out\" the colors of a washed-out image."

msgid "The **Hue** slider specifies how much to shift the hue of the image. Hue 0.5 (in the middle) does not shift the hue or affect the color of the image. As Hue shifts left, the colors shift as more cyan is added; a blue image goes bluer, then greener, then yellow. A red image goes violet, then purple, blue, and finally teal. Shifting right (increasing Hue from 0.5 to 1.0) introduces reds and greens. A blue image goes purple, plum, red, orange, and then yellow. A red image goes golden, olive, green, and cyan."
