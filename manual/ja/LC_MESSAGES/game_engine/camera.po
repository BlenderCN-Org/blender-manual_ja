"The Game Engine camera is in many ways similar to the Camera in the normal "
"Blender Render system, and is created, parameterized and manipulated in "
"similar ways. However because of its use as a real-time device, the Game "
"Engine camera has a number of additional features - it may be used as not "
"only as a static camera, but also as a moving device with its default "
"characteristics (ie. with its own programmed moves), or it may track another"
" object in the game.  Furthermore, any game object may be used as a camera; "
"the view is taken from the object's origin point. Lastly, it may be given "
"special capabilities such as Stereo vision, Dome visualisation etc. which "
"have special relevance to game technology."

"When you start the Game Engine, the initial camera view is taken from the "
"latest 3D View. This may be either a selected camera object  or the default "
"camera (see below). Thus to start the game with a particular camera, you "
"must select the camera and press :kbd:`pad0` before starting the Game "
"Engine."

"The default camera view is taken from the latest 3D viewport view, at a "

msgid ""
"In the Blender interface, there is an option to shift the camera view on the"
" x/y plane of the view. It is comparable to lens shift in video projectors "
"that usually shift the image up along the Y axis. So for example, when you "
"put the beamer on a table it does not project half of the image on the "
"table."
