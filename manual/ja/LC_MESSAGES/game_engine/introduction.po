"Blender has its own built in Game Engine that allows you to create "
"interactive 3D applications or simulations. The major difference between "
"Game Engine and the conventional Blender  system is  in the rendering "
"process. In the normal Blender engine, images and animations are built off-"
"line - once rendered they cannot be modified.  Conversely, the Blender Game "
"Engine renders scenes continuously in real-time, and incorporates facilities"
" for  user interaction during the rendering process."

"By default, the user has access to a powerful, high level, Event Driven "
":doc:`Logic Editor </game_engine/logic/editor>` which is comprised of a "
"seriers of specialised components called \"Logic Bricks\". The :doc:`Logic "
"Editor </game_engine/logic/editor>` provides deep interaction with the "
"simulation, and its functionality can be extended through Python scripting. "
"It is designed to abstract the complex engine features into a simple user "
"interface, which does not require experience with Programming. An overview "
"of the :doc:`Logic Editor </game_engine/logic/editor>` can be found in the "
":doc:`Game Logic Screen Layout </game_engine/screen_layout>`"

"The Game Engine is closely integrated with the existing code base of "
"Blender, which permits quick transitions between the traditional modelling "
"featureset and game-specific functionality provided by the program. In this "
"sense, the Game Engine can be efficiently used in all areas of game design, "
"from prototyping to final release."

"The Game Engine can simulate content within Blender, however it also "
"includes the ability to export a binary run-time to Windows, Linux and "
"MacOS. There is also basic support for mobile platforms with the Android "
"Blender Player GSOC 2012 project."
