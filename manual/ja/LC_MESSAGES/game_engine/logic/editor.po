"The Logic Editor provides the main method of setting up and editing the game"
" logic for the various actors (i.e. objects) that make up the game.  The "
"logic for the objects which are currently selected in the associated 3D "
"panel are displayed as logic bricks, which are shown as a table with three "
"columns, showing sensors, controllers, and actuators, respectively. The "
"links joining the logic bricks conduct the pulses between sensor-controller "
"and controller-actuator."

"Game Property Area Game properties are like variables in other programming "
"languages. They are used to save and access data associated with an object. "
"Several types of properties are available. Properties are declared by "
"clicking the Add Game Property button in this area. For a more in-depth look"
" at the content, layout and available operations in this area, see "
":doc:`Properties </game_engine/logic/properties>`."

"Links Links (3A) indicate the direction of logical flow between objects. "
"Link lines are drawn by :kbd:`Lmb` dragging from one Link node (3B) to "
"another. Links can only be drawn from Sensors to Controllers, or from "
"Controllers to Actuators. You cannot directly link Sensors to Actuators; "
"likewise, Actuators cannot be linked back to Sensors (however special "
"actuator and sensor types are available to provide these connections)."
