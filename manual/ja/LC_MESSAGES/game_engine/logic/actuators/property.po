"You set up two :guilabel:`Collision` sensors, one for enemy bullets, and one"
" for picking up more health. The first one is connected (through an "
":guilabel:`AND` controller) to an :guilabel:`Add Property` actuator with the"
" property hp and the value -10. Every time the player is hit by an enemy "
"bullet he loses 10 hp. The other sensor is connected (through an "
":guilabel:`AND` controller) to an other :guilabel:`Add Property` actuator, "
"this one with the value 50. So every time the player collides with a health "
"item the hp increases by 50. Next you set up a :guilabel:`Property` sensor "
"for an interval, greater than 100. This is connected (through an "
":guilabel:`AND` controller) to an :guilabel:`Assign Property` actuator which"
" is set to 100. So if the players hp increases over 100 it is set to 100."
