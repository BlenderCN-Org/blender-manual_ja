"The licensing of games created for distribution using the Blender Game "

"Blender is distributed as open-source software distributed and owned by the "
"Blender Foundation under the GNU General Public License (GPL).    In brief, "
"while the Blender system itself is available to everyone, you own anything "
"that you make using Blender (scripts, texture, rendered artwork etc.). See "

"Unfortunately, this does not extend to games or other artwork distributed to"
" run under the Blender Standalone Player.  To distribute your game you need "
"to create an executable (run time). What it does is take your Blender .blend"
" file and put it \"inside\" the Standalone Player - a stripped-down version "
"of Blender containing only the functions corresponding to the Blender Game "
"Engine. The resulting executable file falls into the category of "
"\"derivatives\" of the original program (i.e. a hybrid of your file with the"
" Standalone Player itself), and therefore must be licensed as GPL."

"Use the Game Actuator, which enables a basic .blend game file to start. By "
"making a basic file which contains an \"Always\" sensor to run, and allowing"
" this to activate a  \"Game\" actuator to load and run  the full content of "
"your game, this gets round the problem.   Your main file is now \"outside\" "
"the  Standalone Player, so that it need not be open to GPL and is therefore"
"  \"legally protected\". Although your game is not fully protected with this"
" system, it affords a similar level of protection to that used in most other"
" distributed games. The fact that others can access your .blend file does "
"not mean that it can be used for purposes not covered by the license you "
"want."
