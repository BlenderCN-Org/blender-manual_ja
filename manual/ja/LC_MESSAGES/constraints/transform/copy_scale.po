"Here we talk of **scale**, not of **size**! Indeed, you can have two "
"objects, one much bigger than the other, and yet both of them have the same "
"scale. This is also true with bones: in :guilabel:`Pose` mode, they all have"
" a unitary scale when they are in rest position, represented by their "
"visible length."
