"An object or bone can be rotated around the X, Y and Z axes. This constraint"
" restricts the amount of allowed rotations around each axis, through lower "
"and upper bounds."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/constraints/transform/limit_rotation.rst:12
msgid ""
"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the visual "
"and rendered rotations of its owner, its owner's data block still allows (by"
" default) the object or bone to have rotation values outside the minimum and"
" maximum ranges. This can be seen in the :guilabel:`Transform Properties` "
"panel (:kbd:`N`). When an owner is rotated and attempted to be rotated "
"outside the limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries "
"visually and when rendered, but internally, its rotation values will still "
"be changed beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner "
"will seem to jump to its internally specified rotation."

"Similarly, if its owner has an internal rotation that is beyond the limit, "
"rotating it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing until the "
"internal rotation values are back within the limit threshold (unless you "
"enabled the :guilabel:`For Transform` option, see below)."

"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis, locks the owner's rotation "
"around that axis... Although this is possible, using the "
":guilabel:`Transformation Properties` axis locking feature is probably "
"easier."

"These buttons enable the rotation limit around respectively the X, Y and Z "

"We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, the owner can "
"still have rotations out of bounds (as shown by the :guilabel:`Transform "
"Properties` panel). Well, when you enable this button, this is no more "
"possible - the owner transform properties are also limited by the "
"constraint. Note however that the constraint does not directly modifies the "
"rotation values: you have to rotate one way or the other its owner, for this"
" to take effect..."
