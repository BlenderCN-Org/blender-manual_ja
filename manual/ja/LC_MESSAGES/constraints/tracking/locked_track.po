"The :guilabel:`Locked Track` constraint is a bit tricky to explain, both "
"graphically and textually. Basically, it is a :doc:`Track To constraint "
"</constraints/tracking/track_to>`, but with a locked axis, i.e. an axis that"
" cannot rotate (change its orientation). Hence, the owner can only track its"
" target by rotating around this axis, and unless the target is in the plane "
"perpendicular to the locked axis, and crossing the owner, this owner cannot "
"really point at its target."

"Let's take the best real world equivalent: a compass. It can rotate to point"
" in the general direction of its target (the magnetic North, or a neighbor "
"magnet), but it can't point *directly at it*, because it spins like a wheel "
"on an axle. If a compass is sitting on a table and there is a magnet "
"directly above it, the compass can't point to it. If we move the magnet more"
" to one side of the compass, it still can't point *at* the target, but it "
"can point in the general direction of the target, and still obey its "
"restrictions of the axle."

"When using a :guilabel:`Locked Track` constraint, you can think of the "
"target as a magnet, and the owner as a compass. The :guilabel:`Lock` axis "
"will function as the axle around which the owner spins, and the "
":guilabel:`To` axis will function as the compass' needle. Which axis does "
"what is up to you!"

"If you have trouble understanding the buttons of this constraint, read the "
"tool-tips, they are pretty good. If you don't know where your object's axes "
"are, turn on the :guilabel:`Axis` button in the :guilabel:`Object` menu's "
":guilabel:`Draw` panel. Or, if you're working with bones, turn on the "
":guilabel:`Axes` button in the :guilabel:`Armature` menu's "
":guilabel:`Display` panel."

"This constraint was designed to work cooperatively with the :guilabel:`Track"
" To` constraint. If you set the axes buttons right for these two "
"constraints, :guilabel:`Track To` can be used to point the axle at a primary"
" target, and :guilabel:`Locked Track` can spin the owner around that axle to"
" a secondary target."
