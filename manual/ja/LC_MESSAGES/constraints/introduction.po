"Constraints are a way of connecting *transform properties* (position, "
"rotation and scale) between objects. Constraints are in a way the object "
"counterpart of the :doc:`modifiers </modifiers>`, which work on the object "
"*data* (i.e. meshes, curves, etc.)."

"All constraints share a basic :doc:`common interface "
"</constraints/common_interface>`, again with many similarities with the "

"Even though constraints might be very useful in static scenes (as they can "
"help to automatically position/rotate/scale objects), they were first "
"designed for animation, as they allow you to limit/control the freedom of an"
" object, either in absolute (i.e. in global space), or relatively to other "
"objects."

msgid ""
"Also note that constraints internally work using 4x4 transformation matrices"
" only. When you use settings for specific rotation or scaling constraining, "
"this information is being derived from the matrix only, not from settings in"
" a :guilabel:`Bone` or :guilabel:`Object`. Especially for combining "
"rotations with non-uniform or negative scaling this can lead to "
"unpredictable behavior."

"Finally, there is a great rigging feature in Blender: in :guilabel:`Pose` "
"mode, each bone of an armature behaves a bit like a standard object, and, as"
" such, can be constrained. Most constraints work well with both objects and "
"bones, but there are a few exceptions which are noted in the relevant "
"constraints pages."
