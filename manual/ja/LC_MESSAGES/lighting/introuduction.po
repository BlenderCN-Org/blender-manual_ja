"Lighting is a very important topic in rendering, standing equal to modeling,"
" materials and textures. The most accurately modeled and textured scene will"
" yield poor results without a proper lighting scheme, while a simple model "
"can become very realistic if skillfully lit."

"The physics of light bouncing around in the real world is simulated by "
"Ambient Occlusion (a world setting), buffer shadows (which approximate "
"shadows being cast by objects), ray tracing (which traces the path of "
"photons from a light source). Also, within Blender you can use "
":doc:`Indirect lighting </lighting/indirect_lighting>`. Ray tracing, ambient"
" occlusion, and indirect lighting are computer-intensive processes. Blender "
"can perform much faster rendering with its internal scan line renderer, "
"which is a very good scan line renderer indeed. This kind of rendering "
"engine is much faster since it does not try to simulate the real behavior of"
" light, assuming many simplifying hypotheses."

"In this user manual we have placed Lighting before Materials; you should set"
" up your lighting before assigning materials to your meshes. Since the "
"material shaders react to light, without proper lighting, the material "
"shaders will not look right, and you will end up fighting the shader, when "
"it is really the bad lighting that is causing you grief. All of the example "
"images in this section do not use any material setting at all on the ball, "

"Next go to the :guilabel:`Render` context. In the :guilabel:`Render Layers` "

"everything with this color. Using this material, you can now go about "
"adjusting the lighting. Just empty this field to get back to your original "
"materials."
