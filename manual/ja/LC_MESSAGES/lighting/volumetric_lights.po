"« *is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to add lighting effects to a "
"rendered scene. It allows the viewer to see beams of light shining through "
"the environment; seeing sunbeams streaming through an open window is an "
"example of volumetric lighting, also known as God rays. The term seems to "
"have been introduced from cinematography and is now widely applied to 3D "
"modeling and rendering especially in the field of 3D gaming.* *In volumetric"
" lighting, the light cone emitted by a light source is modeled as a "
"transparent object and considered as a container of a \"volume\": as a "
"result, light has the capability to give the effect of passing through an "
"actual three dimensional medium (such as fog, dust, smoke, or steam) that is"
" inside its volume, just like in the real world.* »"

"A classic example is the search light with a visible halo/shaft of light "
"being emitted from it as the search light sweeps around."

"By default Blender does not model this aspect of light. For example when "
"Blender lights something with a :guilabel:`Spot` light, you see the objects "
"and area on the floor lit but not the shaft/halo of light coming from the "
"spotlight as it progresses to its target and would get scattered on the way."

"The halo/shaft of light is caused in the real world by light being scattered"
" by particles in the air, some of which get diverted into your eye and that "
"you perceive as a halo/shaft of light. The scattering of light from a source"
" can be simulated in Blender using various options, but by default is not "
"activated."
