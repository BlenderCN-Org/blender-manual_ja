msgid ""
"This panel allows you to enable an effect that simulates various properties "
"of real sky and atmosphere: the scattering of sunlight as it crosses the "
"kilometers of air overhead. For example, when the Sun is high, the sky is "
"blue (and the horizon, somewhat whitish). When the Sun is near the horizon, "
"the sky is dark blue/purple, and the horizon turns orange. The dispersion of"
" the atmosphere is also more visible when it is a bit foggy: the farther "
"away an object is, the more \"faded\" in light gray it is... Go out into the"
" countryside on a nice hot day, and you will see."

"To enable this effect, you have to use a :guilabel:`Sun` light source. If, "
"as usual, the *position* of the lamp has no importance, its *rotation* is "
"crucial: it determines which hour it is. As a starting point, you should "
"reset rotation of your :guilabel:`Sun` (with :kbd:`alt-R`, or typing ``0`` "
"in each of the three :guilabel:`Rotation` fields :guilabel:`X` / "
":guilabel:`Y` / :guilabel:`Z` in the :guilabel:`Transform Properties` panel "
"- :kbd:`N`). This way, you'll have a nice mid-day sun (in the tropics)."

"Now, there are two important angles for the :guilabel:`Sky/Atmosphere` "
"effect: the \"incidence\" angle (between the light direction and the X-Y "
"plane), which determines the \"hour\" of the day (as you might expect, the "
"default rotation - straight down - is \"mid-day\", a light pointing straight"
" up is \"midnight\", and so on...). And the rotation around the Z axis "
"determines the position of the sun around the camera."
