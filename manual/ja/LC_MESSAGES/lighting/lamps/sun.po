"A :guilabel:`Sun` lamp provides light of constant intensity emitted in a "
"single direction. A :guilabel:`Sun` lamp can be very handy for a uniform "
"clear daylight open-space illumination. In the 3D view, the :guilabel:`Sun` "
"light is represented by an encircled black dot with rays emitting from it, "
"plus a dashed line indicating the direction of the light."

"This direction can be changed by rotating the :guilabel:`Sun` lamp, like any"
" other object, but because the light is emitted in a constant direction, the"
" location of a :guilabel:`Sun` lamp does not affect the rendered result "
"(unless you use the :doc:`\"sky & atmosphere\" option "
"</lighting/lamps/sun/sky_and_atmosphere>`)."
