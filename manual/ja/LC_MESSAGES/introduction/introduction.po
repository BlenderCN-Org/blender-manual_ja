"Blender was first conceived in December 1993 and became a usable product in "
"August 1994 as an integrated application that enables the creation of a "
"diverse range of 2D and 3D content. Blender provides a broad spectrum of "
"modeling, texturing, lighting, animation and video post-processing "
"functionality in one package. Through its open architecture, Blender "
"provides cross-platform interoperability, extensibility, an incredibly small"
" footprint, and a tightly integrated workflow. Blender is one of the most "
"popular Open Source 3D graphics applications in the world."

"Aimed at media professionals and artists world-wide, Blender can be used to "
"create 3D visualizations and still images, as well as broadcast- and cinema-"

"the creation of 3D interactive content for stand-alone playback or video "
"games."

"Blender makes it possible to perform a wide range of 3d-content-creation-"
"oriented tasks. Therefore it may seem daunting when first trying to grasp "
"the basics. However, with a bit of motivation and the right learning "
"material, it is possible to be productive with Blender after a few hours of "
"practice. If you're reading this wiki, it is a good start, though it serves "
"more as a reference. You also have online video tutorials (free and paid) "
"from specialized websites, and several books in the Blender store."

"Despite everything Blender can do, it remains a tool. Great artists create "
"masterpieces, not only by pressing buttons or manipulating brushes, but also"
" by learning and practicing human anatomy, color theory, composition, "
"lighting, traditional animation, photography, psychology and many other "
"areas. 3D content creation software have the added technical complexity and "
"jargon associated with the underpinning technologies. CPUs, GPUs, memory, "
"algorithms, vectors, materials, meshes are the mediums of the digital "
"artist, and understanding them, even broadly, will help you using Blender to"
" its best."
