msgid ""
"With version 2.5, Blender has seen phenomenal improvements in virtually all "
"areas: software, interface, modeling, animation flow, tools, the python API,"
" etc. This is the result of a careful study of use cases, years of additions"
" and community collaboration, and a complete reorganization and rewrite of "
"the software source code. As a result, this is one of the largest projects "
"undertaken on the Blender code base to date."

"Blender 2.5. This is not an exhaustive list of new functionality (that would"
" be too long!) but is rather a concise introduction to the evolution of 2.5 "
"and its major improvements over previous versions."

"**Non Blocking** : Tools and interface options do not block the user from "

"fly."

"The User Interface has been reorganized. Old *Buttons Windows* are now "
"**Properties**. Properties present data to users. Everything you see in the "
"Properties can be animated, driven, and freely changed by the user. This "
"means there are no tools here. These go to the new **Toolbar** of the "
"different editors (like 3D view)."

"Starting at the top level, the Properties editor contains a list of tabs. "
"The list of tabs themselves are organized so that the most general controls "
"appear on the left (Render Properties), while more fine-grained controls "
"(Object>Mesh>Material>Texture) appear on the right, following reading "
"direction. Furthermore, available tabs depend on the selection (i.e. Mesh "
"options are different from Camera options)."
