"Blender for Linux is currently available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. "
"Users with a 32-bit version of Linux must download the 32-bit version of "
"Blender. Users with a 64-bit version of Linux can choose to use either the "
"32-bit or 64-bit version of Blender, however you will likely notice an "
"increase in performance when using the 64-bit version of Blender, especially"
" on systems with large amounts of RAM."

"Many recent Linux distributions enable compositing when hardware support is "

"While many users find this works flawlessly, some graphics cards have buggy "
