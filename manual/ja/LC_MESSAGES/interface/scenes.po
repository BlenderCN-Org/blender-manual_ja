"Scenes are a very useful tool for managing your projects. The Cube model in "
"empty space you see when you open Blender for the first time is the default "
"Scene. You can imagine Scenes to be similar to tabs in your web browser. For"
" example, your web browser can have many tabs open at once. The tabs could "
"be empty, showing identical views of the same web page, showing different "
"views of the same page or show entirely different pages altogether. "
"Blender's Scenes work in much the same way. You can have an empty Scene, a "
"complete independent copy of your Scene or a new copy that links to your "
"original Scene in a number of ways."

"To choose between these options, you need to clearly understand the "

"and Object Data (also known as ObData). The Object holds information about "
"the position, rotation and size of a particular element. The ObData holds "
"information about meshes, material lists and so on. ObData is common to "
"every instance of that particular type of element. Each Object has a link to"
" its associated ObData, and a single ObData may be shared by many Objects."

"Creates new, duplicate copies of all of the Objects in the currently "

" the ObData (meshes, materials and so on) of the corresponding Objects in "

" and size of the Objects in the new Scene without affecting other Scenes, "
"but any modifications to the ObData (meshes, materials *etc*) will also "
"affect other Scenes. This is because a *single instance of* the \"ObData\" "
"is now being shared by all of the Objects in all of the Scenes that link to "
"it. If you want to make changes to an Object in the new Scene independently "
"of the Objects in the other Scenes, you will have to manually make the "
"object in the new Scene a \"single-user\" copy by :kbd:`LMB` the number in "
"the :guilabel:`Object Data` panel of the Properties Window. More information"
" at the :doc:`Window Type </interface/window_types>` page. This has the "
