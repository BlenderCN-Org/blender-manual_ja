"If you want to render an animation, you need to bake your smoke first. "
"Baking is simply calculating a simulation. To bake the smoke, the file must "
"be saved. The calculations are stored in a cache file which can be named. On"
" occasion, Baking may crash Blender. [See troubleshooting]"

"By scrubbing through the timeline or running the animation in the viewport "
"via :kbd:`alt-A` you already did some realtime-baking to the memory. But for"
" rendering the animation, the baked data must be on disk. And before you can"
" bake, you need to save your Blendfile."

"Next select the domain cube and go to the physics tab where you open the "
"Smoke Cache section. Give your cache a file name by entering it into the "
"text box and hitting :kbd:`enter`. By hitting Bake your simulation data is "
"computed and stored to disk. Notice that the scrubbing-bug in the timeline "
"is gone now? At this point you should be able to render the animation."
