"This object will be used as an obstacle in the simulation. As with a fluid "
"object, obstacle objects currently should not intersect. As for fluid "
"objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for obstacles. For objects with a "
"volume, make sure that the normals of the obstacle are calculated correctly,"
" and radiating properly (use the :guilabel:`Flip Normal` button, in "
":guilabel:`Edit mode`, :guilabel:`Mesh Tools` panel, :guilabel:`Editing` "
"context [\\ :kbd:`f9` ]), particularly when using a spinned container. "
"Applying the Modifier :guilabel:`SubSurf` before baking the simulation could"
" also be a good idea if the mesh is not animated."
