"A new type of Ipo Curve, :guilabel:`FluidSim`, is available for fluid domain"
" objects. Unlike most other animatable values in Blender, "
":guilabel:`FluidSim` Ipos cannot be keyframed by simply using the :kbd:`I` "
"key; you must manually set values by clicking in the Ipo window. In order to"
" set a keyframe, you must select the property you wish to animate in the Ipo"
" window and :kbd:`ctrl-Lmb` click to set the keyframe to the desired "
"location in the Ipo window."

"Note that you do not have to be exact on where you click; we recommend that "
"after you set the control point, open the :guilabel:`Transform Properties` "
"panel (:kbd:`N`) and round the X value to a whole frame number, and then set"
" the Y value that you wish."

"A multiplicative factor in the fluid's viscosity coefficient. It must be set"

"Changes the speed of the simulation; like the Speed Control in the VSE can "
"speed up or slow down a video, this curve can speed up or slow down the "
"fluid motion during a frame sequence. If the value for :guilabel:`Fac-Tim` "
"is less than or equal to zero, time (and the fluid) stands still; the fluid "
"freezes. For values between 0.0 and 1.0, the fluid runs slower and will look"
" thicker. 1.0 is normal fluid motion, and values greater than 1.0 will make "
"the fluid flow faster, possibly appearing thinner."

"The XYZ vector for gravity changes; aka inertia of the fluid itself (think "

"When Active transitions from 0.0 to something greater than 0 (such as "
"between 0.1 and 1.0), the object's function (designated as an "
":guilabel:`Inflow`, or :guilabel:`Outflow`, etc.) resumes its effect. "
"Crossing down to 0.0 and then at some point, back up, re-establishes the "
"effect and the resulting fluid sim. Use this for dripping, or any kind of "
"intermittent inflow. This active status also works for objects designated as"
" :guilabel:`Outflow` and :guilabel:`Obstacle`, so you can also simulate (for"
" example) a drain plugging up."
