"Complete positions are saved for units of time (frames). An animation is "
"created by interpolating an object fluidly through the frames. The advantage"
" of this method is that it allows you to work with clearly visualized units."
" The animator can work from one position to the next and can change "
"previously created positions, or move them in time."

#: ../manual/animation/introduction.rst:23
msgid ""
"Curves are interpolated from keyframes, and can be drawn for each XYZ "
"component for location, rotation, and size, as well as any other attribute "
"in Blender. These form the graphs for the movement, with time set out "
"horizontally and the value set out vertically. The advantage of this method "
"is that it gives you precise control over the results of the movement."
