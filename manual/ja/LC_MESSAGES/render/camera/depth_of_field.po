"Real world camera lenses and your eyeball transmit light through a lens "
"(cornea) that bends the light, and an iris that limits the amount of light, "
"to focus the image onto the film, CCD/Cmos sensor, or retina. Because of the"
" interaction of the lens and iris, objects that are a certain distance away "
"are in focus; objects in the foreground and background are out of focus. We "
"call this distance their depth, or \"Z\" distance from the camera or eye."

"Light comes to the lens (in the real world) at an angle; from some "
"direction. What you see depends on your perspective; if you move closer, "
"different angles of the scene are revealed. To make \"flat\" pictures, like "
"an architectural drawing or plot, Blender can also make an orthographic "
"rendering. So, there are two kinds of renderings, Perspective and "
"Orthographic. Perspective simulates light coming in at an angle to the lens "
"from the field of view, and Orthographic (disabled by default) simulates "
"light coming straight in to an infinitely large backplane or flat retina."

"Depending on the diameter of the iris, there is a range (of distance) where "
"objects are in focus. In cameras, the diameter of the iris is controlled by "
"an \"f-stop\". Said another way, there is *field* of view that you see left "
"to right, up and down; your \"picture\", if you will. At a certain range, or"
" *depth* away from your eye, things are in focus. For example, at night, you"
" may be able to focus your eye on objects that are 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 "
"meters) away. Anything closer than 10 or farther away than 15 is blurry. "
"Your **depth of field** is thus 5 feet (2 m)."

"The larger the iris, the smaller the depth of field. This is why, during the"
" day, you can focus on a range of things stretching out far from you. In "
"film, there is a person whose job is to measure the distance from the camera"
" to the actor's nose, to ensure that the focus is set perfectly."

"The more that an object is out of its depth (the perfect value for this "
"depth is called *focal plane*), the blurrier it is. In fact, the depth of "
"field is the range on both sides of the focal plane in which the blurriness "
"of the objects is considered to be low enough to be imperceptible. In "
"Blender, this distance is called the :guilabel:`Dof Dist` or \"Depth of "
"Field Distance\" and is set in the :guilabel:`Editing` context (:kbd:`f9`) "
"for the camera. Alternatively, you can have the camera automatically stay "
"focused on an object, by entering the name of the object in the "
":guilabel:`Dof Ob` field."

msgid ""
"The field of view varies by the size of the lens. With cameras, a 35mm lens "
"is kind of a standard size because the picture it takes mimics the size of "
"the picture seen by the eye and pictures can be taken rather close. In "
"Blender, use the :guilabel:`Camera` settings to change the size of the lens "
"(35mm is the default). A longer lens taking a picture farther away has the "
"same field of view, but has a different perspective of the view that many "
"directors love because it \"condenses\" the scene and smooths a sweep, since"
" it is farther away from the action:"

"Zoom is the ability to expand a subset of the picture; we humans have no "
"such ability. Well, I take that back; we do: we just get up off the couch "
"and walk up closer to what we want to see (however, this is more like "
"\"traveling\" than \"zooming\"). Blender allows you both actions: you can "
"move the camera closer to or farther away from an object for a track (or "
"\"truck\") in/out, and/or change its lens size. You can automate these by "
"assigning an Interpolated (Ipo) curve to the object or to the camera, "
"respectively."

msgid ""
"In computer graphics (CG), there is no physical lens or iris, so the depth-"
"of-field (DOF) is infinite and all objects are always in focus. However, for"
" artistic reasons, we want our main characters to be in focus, and "
"everything else a little blurry, so that our audience does not focus on "
"distracting things in the background. Also, it is easier to discern the main"
" actors when they are in focus, and everything else isn't. So, we have to "
"create an effect, or **Depth of Field Effect**, to composite our images and "
"post-process them to achieve realistic-looking results."
