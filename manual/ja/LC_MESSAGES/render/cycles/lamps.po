"Next to lighting from the background and any object with an emission shader,"
" lamps are another way to add light into the scene. The difference is that "
"they are not directly visible in the rendered image, and can be more easily "
"managed as objects of their own type."

"Currently **Point**, **Spot**, **Area** and **Sun** lamps are supported. "
"Hemi lamps are not supported, and will be rendered as point and sun lamps "
"respectively, but they may start working in the future, so it's best not to "
"enable them to preserve compatibility."

"By disabling this option, light from lamps will not be blocked by objects "
"in-between. This can speed up rendering by not having to trace rays to the "
"light source."

msgid "Point Lamp"
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:26
msgid ""
"Point lamps emit light equally in all directions. By setting the "
":guilabel:`Size` larger than zero, they become spherical lamps, which give "
"softer shadows and shading. The strength of point lamps is specified in "
"Watts."

msgid ""
"Spot lamps emit light in a particular direction, inside a cone. By setting "
"the :guilabel:`Size` larger than zero, they can cast softer shadows and "
"shading. The size parameter defines the size of the cone, while the blend "
"parameter can soften the edges of the cone."

msgid ""
"Sun lamps emit light in a given direction. Their position is not taken into "
"account; they are always located outside of the scene, infinitely far away, "
"and will not result in any distance falloff."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:53
msgid ""
"Because they are not located inside the scene, their strength uses different"
" units, and should typically be set to lower values than other lights."
