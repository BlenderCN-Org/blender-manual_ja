"Cycles is bundled as an addon that is enabled by default. To use Cycles, it "
"must be set as the active render engine in the top header. Once that is "
"done, interactive rendering can be started by setting a 3D view editor to "
"draw mode Rendered. The render will keep updating as material and object "
"modifications are done."
