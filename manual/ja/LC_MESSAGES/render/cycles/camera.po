"This projection is compatible with the environment texture as used for world"
" shaders, so it can be used to render an environment map. To match the "
"default mapping, set the camera object rotation to (90, 0, -90) or pointing "
"along the positive X-axis. This corresponds to looking at the center of the "
"image using the default environment texture mapping."

"Fisheye lenses are typically wide angle lenses with strong distortion, "
"useful for creating panoramic images for e.g. dome projection, or as an "
"artistic effect. The :guilabel:`Fisheye Equisolid` lens will best match real"
" cameras. It provides a lens focal length and field of view angle, and will "
"also take the sensor dimensions into account."

"The :guilabel:`Fisheye Equidistant` lens does not correspond to any real "
"lens model; it will give a circular fisheye that doesn't take any sensor "
"information into account but rather uses the whole sensor. This is a good "
"lens for full dome projection."

"tracing does not suffer from this issue much, and as such more extreme "
"values can safely be set."
