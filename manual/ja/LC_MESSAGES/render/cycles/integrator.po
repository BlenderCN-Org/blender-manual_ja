"The integrator is the rendering algorithm used to compute the lighting. "
"Cycles currently supports a path tracing integrator with direct light "
"sampling. It works well for various lighting setups, but is not as suitable "
"for caustics and some other complex lighting situations."

"Rays are traced from the camera into the scene, bouncing around until they "
"find a light source such as a lamp, an object emitting light, or the world "
"background. To find lamps and surfaces emitting light, both indirect light "
"sampling (letting the ray follow the surface BSDF) and direct light sampling"
" (picking a light source and tracing a ray towards it) are used."

"There are two integrator modes that can be used: path tracing and branched "
"path tracing. The **path tracing integrator** is a pure path tracer; at each"
" hit it will bounce light in one direction and pick one light to receive "
"lighting from. This makes each individual sample faster to compute, but will"
" typically require more samples to clean up the noise."

"The **branched path tracing integrator** (formerly called non-progressive "

"noise, especially in scenes dominated by direct or one-bounce lighting. To "
"get the same number of diffuse samples as in the path tracing integrator, "
