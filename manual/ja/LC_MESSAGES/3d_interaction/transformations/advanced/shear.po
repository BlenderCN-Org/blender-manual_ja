"Shearing is a form of movement where parallel surfaces move past one "
"another. During this transform, movement of the selected elements will occur"
" along the horizontal axis of the current view. The axis location will be "
"defined by the :guilabel:`Pivot Point`. Everything that is \"above\" this "
"axis will move (Shear) in the same direction as your mouse pointer (but "
"always parallel to the horizontal axis). Everything that is \"below\" the "
"horizontal axis will move in the opposite direction."

"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the "
":guilabel:`Shear` transform function. The :guilabel:`Shear` option can be "
"invoked from the :menuselection:`Object/Mesh/Curve/Surface --> Transform -->"
" Shear` menu option or by pressing :kbd:`shift-ctrl-alt-s`. The amount of "
"movement given to the selection can be determined interactively by moving "
"the mouse or by typing a number. Pressing :kbd:`Enter` will confirm the "
"transformation. The confirmed transformation can be further edited by "
"pressing F6 or by going into the Toolshelf (:kbd:`T`) and altering the "
"Offset slider provided that no other actions take place between the "
":guilabel:`Shear` transform confirmation and accessing the slider."

"The three frames of the image above show the effects of shearing on the "
"selected vertices when the pivot point is altered. In frame B, the "
":guilabel:`Pivot Point` is set to :guilabel:`Median Point` (indicated by the"
" yellow line) and the mouse was moved to the left during the transform. In "
"frame C, the :guilabel:`Pivot Point` is set to the 3D cursor which is "
"located above the mesh (indicated again by the yellow line). When the mouse "
"is moved to the left during a :guilabel:`Shear` transform the selected "
"vertices are moved to the right as they are below the horizontal axis."
