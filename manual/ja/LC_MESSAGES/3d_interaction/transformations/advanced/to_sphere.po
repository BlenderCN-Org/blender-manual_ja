"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the :guilabel:`To "
"Sphere` transform function. The :guilabel:`To Sphere` option can be invoked "
"from the :menuselection:`Mesh --> Transform --> To Sphere` menu option or by"
" pressing :kbd:`shift-alt-s`. The amount of sphericity given to the "
"selection can be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a"
" number between 0 and 1. Pressing :kbd:`Enter` will confirm the "
"transformation. The confirmed transformation can be further edited by "
"pressing :kbd:`F6` or by going into the :guilabel:`Toolshelf` (:kbd:`T`) and"
" altering the :guilabel:`Factor` slider provided that no other actions take "
"place between the :guilabel:`To Sphere` transform confirmation and accessing"
" the slider."

"Note that the result of the :guilabel:`To Sphere` transform is also "
"dependant on the number of selected mesh elements (vertices, faces etc). As "
"can be seen in the below image, the result will be smoother and more "
"spherical when there are more mesh elements available to work with."
