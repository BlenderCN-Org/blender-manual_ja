"The :guilabel:`Grease Pencil` is a tool that allows you to draw sketches and"
" annotations in the 3D view and UV/Image editor windows using freehand "
"strokes. It is a tool that can be linked back to traditional 2D paper and "
"pencil workflows where rough \"guideline\" sketches were often used for "
"planning and quickly communicating ideas. In digital fields, a similar "
"workflow was used by drawing on monitors with wax crayons and pencils. It is"
" often useful to be able to directly scribble on to a work in progress "
"instead of having to do so in a separate place (i.e. another part of the "
"window, or even in a different application altogether)."
