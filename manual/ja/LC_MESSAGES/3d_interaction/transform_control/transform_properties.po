"The :guilabel:`Transform Properties` section in the :guilabel:`View "
"Properties` panel allows you to view and manually/numerically control the "
"position, rotation, and other properties of an object, in :guilabel:`Object`"
" mode. In :guilabel:`Edit` mode, it mainly allows you to enter precise "
"coordinates for a vertex, or median position for a group of vertices "
"(including an edge/face). As each type of object has a different set of "
"options in its :guilabel:`Transform Properties` panel in :guilabel:`Edit` "
"mode, see their respective descriptions in the :doc:`Modeling chapter "

"The locking feature of the Location, Rotation and Scale fields allows you to"
" control a transform property solely from the properties panel. Once a lock "
"has been activated any other methods used for transformation are blocked. "
"For example, if you locked the :guilabel:`Location X` field then you can't "
"use the mouse to translate the object along the global X axis. However, you "
"can still translate it using the :guilabel:`Location X` edit field. Consider"
