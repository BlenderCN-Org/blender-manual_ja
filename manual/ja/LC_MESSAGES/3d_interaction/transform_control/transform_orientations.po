"The manipulator matches the global axis. When using the Global orientation, "
"the orientation's x,y,z matches world's x,y,z axis. When this mode is "
"selected, the local coordinates of the object are subjected to the Global "
"coordinates. This is good to place objects in the scene. To constrain an "
"axis, hit :kbd:`g` and the desired axis. To constrain to a local axis, hit "
"the desired axis two times. The difference between Global and Local, is more"
" noticeable when you have an object in which the origin is not located at "

"The manipulator matches the object axis. Notice that, here, the Manipulator "
"is at a slight tilt (it is most visible on the object's y-axis, the green "
"arrow). This is due to our 15º rotation of the object. This demonstrates the"
" difference between local coordinates and global coordinates. If we had "
"rotated the object 90º along its x-axis, we would see that the object's "
"\"Up\" is the world's \"Forward\" -- or the object's z-axis would now be the"
" world's y-axis. This orientation has an effect on many parts of the "
