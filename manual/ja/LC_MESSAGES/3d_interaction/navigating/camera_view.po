"Cameras View can be used to virtually compose shots and preview how the "
"scene will look when rendered. Pressing :kbd:`pad0` will show the scene as "
"viewed from the currently active camera. In this view you can also set the "
":guilabel:`Render Border` which defines the portion of the camera view to be"
" rendered."

"While in camera view, you can define a :guilabel:`Render Border` by pressing"
" :kbd:`Ctrl-B`. This will allow you to draw out a dotted orange rectangle "
"within the camera view. Your renders will now be limited to the part of "
"scene visible within the render border. This can be very useful for reducing"
" render times. The border can be disabled by disabling the "
":guilabel:`Border` option in the :guilabel:`Dimensions` panel of the "
":guilabel:`Render` context or by using :kbd:`Ctrl-B` to set a "
":guilabel:`Render Border` larger than the camera view."
