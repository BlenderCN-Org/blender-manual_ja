"based on the current view settings, by transforming the points recorded when"
" drawing (which make up the strokes) into 3D-space. Currently, all points "
"will be used, so it may be necessary to simplify or subdivide parts of the "
"created geometry for standard use."

"Stroke's width will be used to set the curve's control points' radii and "

" multiply it by a given constant (0.1), and to assign it directly to "
"weights. Radii get the same value scaled by the :guilabel:`Radius Fac` "
