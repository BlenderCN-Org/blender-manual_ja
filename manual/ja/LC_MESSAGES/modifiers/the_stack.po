"A modifier is defined as the application of a \"process\" or \"algorithm\" "
"upon objects. They can be applied interactively and non-destructively in "
"just about any order the users chooses. This kind of functionality is often "
"referred to as a \"modifier stack\" and is found in several other 3D "
"applications."

"Modifiers are added from the :guilabel:`Modifiers` menu. Some tools and "
"scripts, for example :guilabel:`Decimate` and :guilabel:`Solidify`, have "
"been migrated from its previous location and changed into a modifier. In a "
"modifier stack the order in which modifiers are applied has an effect on the"
" result. Fortunately modifiers can be rearranged easily by clicking the "
"convenient up and down arrow icons. For example, (*Stack ordering*) shows "
":doc:`SubSurf </modifiers/generate/subsurf>` and :doc:`Mirror "
"</modifiers/generate/mirror>` modifiers that have switched places."
