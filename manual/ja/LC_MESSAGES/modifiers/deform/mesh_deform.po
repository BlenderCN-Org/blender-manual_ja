"The :guilabel:`Mesh Deform` modifier allows an arbitrary closed mesh (of any"

msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Bind` button is what tells the :guilabel:`Mesh Deform` "
"modifier to actually link the deform mesh cage to the deformed object, so "
"that altering the shape of the deform mesh cage actually alters the shape of"
" the deformed object. Be aware that depending on the settings of the "
":guilabel:`Mesh Deform` modifier and complexity of the deform mesh cage "
"and/or deformed object, it can take a long time for this operation to "
"complete.  This can result in Blender not responding to user's actions until"
" it has completed, it is even possible that Blender will run out of memory "
"and crash."

msgid ""
"When a deformed object has been associated to a deform mesh cage, it can "
"later be disassociated by selecting the :guilabel:`Unbind` button which "
"replaced the :guilabel:`Bind` one. When :guilabel:`Unbind` is clicked, the "
"*deform mesh cage* will keep its current shape; it will not reset itself "
"back to its original start shape. If you need its original shape, you will "
"have to save a copy of it before you alter it. The deformed object will, "
"however, reset back to its original shape that it had before it was bound to"
" the deform mesh cage."

msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Precision` numeric slider field controls the accuracy with "
"which the deform mesh cage alters the deformed object, when the points on "
"the cage are moved. The range of values for the :guilabel:`Precision` field "
"can range from ``2`` to ``10``, the default being ``5``. Raising this value "
"higher can greatly increase the time it takes the :guilabel:`Mesh Deform` "
"modifier to complete its binding calculations, but it will get more accurate"
" cage mapping to the deformed object. This rise in calculation time can make"
" Blender stop responding until it has calculated what it needs to. As well "
"as making Blender not respond, raising the :guilabel:`Precision` value high "
"and then trying to :guilabel:`Bind` on a very complex deform mesh cage "
"and/or deformed object can use large amounts of memory and in extreme cases "
"crash Blender.  To be safe, save your blend file before proceeding! This "
"setting becomes unavailable once a cage has been bound."

msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Dynamic` button indicates to the :guilabel:`Mesh Deform` "
"modifier that it should also take into account deformations and changes to "
"the underlying deformed object which were not a direct result of deform mesh"
" cage alteration. With the :guilabel:`Dynamic` button activated, other mesh "
"altering features (such as other modifiers and shape keys) are taken into "
"account when binding a deform mesh cage to the deformed object, increasing "
"deformation quality. It is deactivated by default to save memory and "
"processing time when binding... Like with :guilabel:`Precision`, this "
"setting is unavailable once a cage has been bound."

"Besides the outer cage, more faces within the cage, either loose or forming "
"another smaller cage, can be used for extra control. Such smaller cages may "
"also overlap with the main cage; for example, to get extra control over "
"eyes, two small sphere cages could be added around them."
