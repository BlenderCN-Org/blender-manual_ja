"The :guilabel:`Armature` modifier is used for building skeletal systems for "
"animating the poses of characters and anything else which needs to be posed."
" With the :guilabel:`Vertex Group` and :guilabel:`Multi Modifier` options, "
"you can use several armatures to animate a single (mesh) object."

msgid ""
"By adding an armature system to an object, that object can be deformed "
"accurately so that geometry doesn't have to be animated by hand. The "
":guilabel:`Armature` modifier allows objects to be deformed by bones simply "
"by specifying the name of the armature object, without having to use the "
"(old) \"parent/child\" system."
