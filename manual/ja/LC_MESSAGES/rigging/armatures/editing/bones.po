"*If the root of a locked bone is connected to the tip of an unlocked bone, "
"it won't be locked*, i.e. you will be able to move it to your liking. This "
"means that in a chain of connected bones, when you lock one bone, you only "
"really lock its tip. With unconnected bones, the locking is effective on "
"both ends of the bone."

"Another very useful tool is the :guilabel:`X-Axis Mirror` editing option "
"(:guilabel:`Tool panel` > :guilabel:`Armature Options`, while Armature is "
"selected in :guilabel:`Edit Mode`), working a bit like the same :doc:`mesh "
"editing tool </modeling/meshes/tools/transform_deform#mirror_editing>`. When"
" you have pairs of bones of the same name with just a different \"side "
"suffix\" (e.g. ``.R`` / ``.L``, or ``_right`` / ``_left`` ...), once this "
"option is enabled, each time you transform (move/rotate/scale...) a bone, "
"its \"other side\" counterpart will be transformed accordingly, through a "
"*symmetry along the armature local X axis*. As most rigs have at least one "
"axis of symmetry (animals, humans, ...), it's an easy way to spare you half "
"of the editing work! See also :doc:`next page "
"</rigging/armatures/editing/properties#naming_bones>` for more on naming "
"bones."
