"Textures need mapping coordinates, to determine how they are applied to the "
"object. The mapping specifies how the texture will ultimately wrap itself to"
" the object."

"For example, a 2D image texture could be configured to wrap itself around a "
"cylindrical shaped object."

":guilabel:`Coordinates` Mapping works by using a set of coordinates to guide"
" the mapping process. These coordinates can come from anywhere, usually the "
"object to which the texture is being applied to."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:28
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Global` The scene's global 3D coordinates. This is also useful "
"for animations; if you move the object, the texture moves across it. It can "
"be useful for letting objects appear or disappear at a certain position in "
"space."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:32
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Object` Uses an object as source for coordinates.  Often used "
"with an :guilabel:`Empty`, this is an easy way to place a small image at a "
"given point on the object (see the FIXME(TODO: Internal Link; [[#Position a "
"Decal on a Mesh|example below]])). This object can also be animated, to move"
" a texture around or through a surface."

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:38
msgid ":guilabel:`Object` Select the name of an object."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:40
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Generated` The original undeformed coordinates of the object.  "
"This is the default option for mapping textures."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:42
msgid ""
":guilabel:`UV` UV mapping is a very precise way of mapping a 2D texture to a"
" 3D surface. Each vertex of a mesh has its own UV co-ordinates which can be "
"unwrapped and laid flat like a skin. You can almost think of UV coordinates "
"as a mapping that works on a 2D plane with its own local coordinate system "
"to the plane on which it is operating on. This mapping is especially useful "
"when using 2D images as textures, as seen in :doc:`UV Mapping "
"</textures/mapping/uv>`. You can use multiple textures with one set of UV "
"coordinates."

msgid ":guilabel:`Layer` Select your UV layer to use it for mapping."

":guilabel:`Strand/Particle` Uses normalized 1D strand texture coordinate or "
"particle age(X) and trail position (Y). Use when texture is applied to hair "
"strands or particles."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:56
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Sticky` Uses a mesh's sticky coordinates, which are a form of "
"per-vertex UV co-ordinates. If you have made sticky coordinates first (in "
"(usually) :guilabel:`Camera View` → :kbd:`Space` → type :guilabel:`Sticky` →"
"  choose :guilabel:`Add Sticky` / :guilabel:`Remove Sticky`), the texture "
"can be rendered in camera view (so called :doc:`Camera Mapping "
"</ls/textures/uv/camera_mapping>`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:61
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Window` The rendered image window coordinates. This is well "
"suited to blending two objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:63
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Normal` Uses the direction of the surface's normal vector as "
"coordinates. This is very useful when creating certain special effects that "
"depend on viewing angle."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:66
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Reflection` Uses the direction of the reflection vector as "
"coordinates. This is useful for adding reflection maps — you will need this "
"input when Environment Mapping."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:69
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Stress` Uses the difference of edge length compared to original "
"coordinates of the mesh. This is useful, for example, when a mesh is "
"deformed by modifiers."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:72

":guilabel:`Flat` Flat mapping gives the best results on single planar faces."
" It does produce interesting effects on the sphere, but compared to a "
"sphere-mapped sphere the result looks flat. On faces that are not in the "
"mapping plane the last pixel of the texture is extended, which produces "
"stripes on the cube and cylinder."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:91
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Cube` Cube mapping often gives the most useful results when the "
"objects are not too curvy and organic (notice the seams on the sphere)."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:94
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Tube` Tube mapping maps the texture around an object like a label"
" on a bottle. The texture is therefore more stretched on the cylinder. This "
"mapping is of course very good for making the label on a bottle or assigning"
" stickers to rounded objects. However, this is not a cylindrical mapping so "
"the ends of the cylinder are undefined."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:99
msgid ""
":guilabel:`Sphere` Sphere mapping is the best type for mapping a sphere, and"
" it is perfect for making planets and similar objects. It is often very "
"useful for creating organic objects. It also produces interesting effects on"
" a cylinder."

"These buttons allow you to change the mapping of axes between the texture's "
"own coordinate system, and the mapping system you choose (Generated, UV, "
"etcetera.) More precisely, to each axis of the texture corresponds one of "
"four choices, that allow you to select to which axis in the mapping system "
"it maps! This implies several points:"

"For 2D textures (such as images), only the first two rows are relevant, as "

"You can rotate a 2D picture a quarter turn by setting the first row (i.e. X "

"When you map no texture axis (i.e. the three \"void\" buttons are set), "
"you'll get a solid uniform texture, as you use zero dimension (i.e. a dot, "
"or pixel) of it (and then Blender extends or repeats this point's color "
"along all axes.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:143
msgid ""
"When you only map one texture axis (i.e. two \"void\" buttons are enabled) "
"you'll get a \"striped\" texture, as you only use one dimension (i.e. a line"
" of pixel) of it, (and then Blender stretches this line along the two other "
"axes)."
msgstr ""

#: ../manual/textures/mapping.rst:146
msgid ""
"The same goes, for 3D textures (i.e. procedural ones), when one axis is "
"mapped to nothing, Blender extends the plan (\"slice\") along the relevant "

"So, all this is a bit hard to understand and master. Fortunately, you do not"
" have to change these settings often, except for some special effects... "
"Anyway, the only way to get used to them is to practice!"
