"Curve selection in :guilabel:`Edit` mode is much less complex than with "
"meshes! Mainly this is because you have only one selectable element type, "
"the control points (no select mode needed here...). These points are a bit "
"more complex than simple vertices, however, especially for Béziers, as there"
" is the central vertex, and its two handles..."

"The basic tools are the same as with :doc:`meshes "

"One word about the Bézier control points: when you select the main central "
"vertex, the two handles are automatically selected too, so you can grab it "
"as a whole, without creating an angle in the curve. However, when you select"
" a handle, only this vertex is selected, allowing you to modify this control"
" vector..."

":kbd:`L` (or :kbd:`ctrl-L`) will add to the selection the cursor's nearest "
"control point, and all the linked ones, i.e. all points belonging to the "
"same curve. Note that for Bézier, using :kbd:`L` with a handle selected will"
" select the whole control point and all the linked ones."
