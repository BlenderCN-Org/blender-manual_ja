"As seen in the previous sections, polygons are central to Blender. Most "
"objects are represented by polygons and truly curved objects are often "
"approximated by polygon meshes. When rendering images, you may notice that "
"these polygons appear as a series of small, flat faces."

"The easiest way is to set an entire object as smooth or faceted by selecting"
" a mesh object, and in :guilabel:`Object` mode, click :guilabel:`Smooth` in "
"the :guilabel:`Tool Shelf`. This button does not stay pressed; it forces the"

"Notice that the outline of the object is still strongly faceted. Activating "
"the smoothing features doesn't actually modify the object's geometry; it "
"changes the way the shading is calculated across the surfaces, giving the "
"illusion of a smooth surface. Click the :guilabel:`Flat` button in the "
":guilabel:`Tool Shelf` 's :guilabel:`Shading panel` to revert the shading "
"back to that shown in the first image above."

"It can be difficult to create certain combinations of smooth and solid faces"

"Auto smoothing can be enabled in the mesh's panel in the "
