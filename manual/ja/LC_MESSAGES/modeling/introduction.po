"As you have seen in the :doc:`Quick Start "
"</your_first_animation/1.a_static_gingerbread_man>` chapter, the creation of"
" a 3D scene needs at least three key things: Models, Materials and Lights. "
"In this Part we will delve deeper into the first of these issues: modeling. "
"Modeling is the art and science of creating a surface that mimics the shape "
"of a real-world object or fits your imagination of abstract objects."

"Many people use \"box modeling\" which starts with a basic cube, and "
"proceeds with extruding faces and moving vertices to create a larger, more "
"complicated mesh. For flat objects, like walls and table tops, you can use "
"\"curve modeling\" which defines the outline using bezier or Nurbs curves, "
"and then extrudes it to the desired thickness. Either method is fully "
"supported in Blender using its modeling tools."
