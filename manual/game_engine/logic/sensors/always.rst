   Always sensor


The :guilabel:`Always` sensor is used for things that need to be done every logic tick,
or at every *x* logic tick (with non-null :guilabel:`f`), or at start-up
(with :guilabel:`Tap`).

See :doc:`Sensor Common Options </game_engine/logic/sensors/common_options>` for common options.

This sensor doesn't have any special options.
