   Mirroring a selection.


Mirroring an Object or Mesh selection will create a reversed version of the selection. The
position of the mirrored version of the selection is determined by the :guilabel:`Pivot
Point.` A common use of mirroring is to model half an object, duplicate it and then use the
mirror transform to create a reversed version to complete the model.
Note that mirrored duplicates can also be created with a :guilabel:`Mirror modifier.`

Usage
-----

To mirror a selection along a particular global axis press:


:kbd:`ctrl-M`, followed by :kbd:`x`, :kbd:`y` or :kbd:`z`.


The image :guilabel:`Mirroring a selection` shows the results of this action after a mesh
element has been duplicated.


----

In Mesh mode, you can mirror the selection on the currently selected Transform Orientation by
pressing the appropriate axis key a second time. For example,
if the Transform Orientation is set to :guilabel:`Normal`, pressing:


:kbd:`ctrl-m`, followed by :kbd:`x` and then :kbd:`x` again


will mirror the selection along the X-axis of the :guilabel:`Normal Orientation.`

   Interactive mirror.


----

You can alternatively hold the :kbd:`mmb` to interactively mirror the object by moving
the mouse in the direction of the mirror axis.
