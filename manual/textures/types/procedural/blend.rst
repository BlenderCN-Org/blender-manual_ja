   Blend Texture Panels


Often used for
   This is one of the most frequently used procedural textures.
   You can use blend textures to blend other textures together (with :guilabel:`Stencil`),
   or to create nice effects (especially with the :guilabel:`Mapping: Normal` trick).
   Just remember: if you use a ramp to create a custom blending, you may have to use :guilabel:`No RGB`,
   if the :guilabel:`Mapping` value needs an intensity input.
Result(s)
   Intensity. The Blend texture generates a smoothly interpolated progression.
