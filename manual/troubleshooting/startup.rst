Startup

If blender crashes on startup there are a few things to check for:

- OpenGL version. Make sure a graphics card driver with support for OpenGL version 1.4 at least is installed
  Check your graphics hardware manual and/or graphics vendor webpage for updated drivers.
  Note: a graphics card with OpenGL support will not work without a driver. Some windows installations
  come without a driver installation, even though the computer hardware is capable of supporting OpenGL.
  To detect your OpenGL version, you can use external software, like OpenGL extensions viewer(glview) on windows 
  or glxinfo on Linux.
- Make sure you are using the correct version (32 or 64 bit) for your operating system.

MS-Windows

Make sure the latest service packs for your operating system are installed.
