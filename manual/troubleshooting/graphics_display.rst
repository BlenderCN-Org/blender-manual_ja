Blender depends on OpenGL, a multi-platform 3D graphics system, to draw its interface.
A graphics driver with OpenGL version 1.4 support is needed to run blender.

Graphics applications also tend to be memory intensive and also graphics drivers can be buggy sometimes,
causing graphical glitches or crashes.

- Using Multisample anti-aliasing will increase the memory use and make display slower.
- On some computers, using the :term:`VBO` option will result in instability.
- Region Overlap and Triple buffering will also use more graphics card memory.
