Add-ons
*******

The Add-Ons tab lets you manage secondary options which are not enabled in Blender by default.
New features may be added with *Install Add-Ons*.
There will be a growing number of such Add-Ons,
generated by the Blender-community so look out for that one feature you were missing
(or maybe simply create it yourself).

See the :doc:`Add-Ons Page </extensions/python/add_ons>` for more on using Add-Ons.
