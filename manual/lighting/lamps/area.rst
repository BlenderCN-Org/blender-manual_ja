Area Lamp
*********

The :guilabel:`Area` lamp simulates light originating from a surface (or surface-like)
emitter. For example, a TV screen, your supermarket's neon lamps, a window,
or a cloudy sky are just a few types of area lamp. The area lamp produces shadows with soft
borders by sampling a lamp along a grid the size of which is defined by the user.
This is in direct contrast to point-like artificial lights which produce sharp borders.

Lamp options
============

Distance, Energy and Color
   These settings are common to most types of lamps, and are described in :doc:`Light Properties </lighting/lights/light_properties>`.

   Note that the :guilabel:`Distance` setting is much more sensitive and important for :guilabel:`Area` lamps than for others; usually any objects within the range of :guilabel:`Distance` will be blown out and overexposed. For best results, set the :guilabel:`Distance` to just below the distance to the object that you want to illuminate.

Gamma
   Amount to gamma correct the brightness of illumination. Higher values give more contrast and shorter falloff.

   The :guilabel:`Area` lamp doesn't have light falloff settings. It uses an "inverse quadratic" attenuation law. The only way to control its falloff is to use the :guilabel:`Distance` and/or :guilabel:`Gamma` settings.

This Layer Only, Negative, Specular and Diffuse
   These settings control what the lamp affects, as described in :doc:`What Light Affects </lighting/lights/what_light_affects>`.


Shadows
=======

Area light ray-traced shadows are described here: :doc:`Raytraced Shadows </lighting/lamps/area/raytraced_shadows>`.

When an :guilabel:`Area` light source is selected,
the :guilabel:`Shadow` panel has the following default layout:

Area Shape
==========

The shape of the area light can be set to :guilabel:`Square` or :guilabel:`Rectangle`.

   Rectangle options


Square / Rectangular
   Emit light from either a square or a rectangular area
Size / Size X / Size Y
   Dimensions for the :guilabel:`Square` or :guilabel:`Rectangle`


.. note:: Shape Tips

   Choosing the appropriate shape for your :guilabel:`Area` light will enhance the believability of your scene.
   For example, you may have an indoor scene and would like to simulate light entering through a window.
   You could place a :guilabel:`Rectangular` area lamp in a window (vertical) or from neons (horizontal)
   with proper ratios for :guilabel:`Size X` and :guilabel:`Size Y`. For the simulation of the light emitted by a
   TV screen a vertical :guilabel:`Square` area lamp would be better in most cases.
