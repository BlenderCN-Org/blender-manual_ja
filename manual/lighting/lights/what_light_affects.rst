   Lamp panel with the light affecting options highlighted


Every lamp has a set of switches that control which objects receive its light,
and how it interacts with materials.

Negative
   The light produced by the lamp is **subtracted** from the one "available" on the surfaces it hits, which darkens these surfaces instead of brightening them.

This Layer Only
   Causes the lamp to only light objects on the same layer.

Diffuse
   Prevents the lamp from producing :doc:`diffuse light </materials/properties/diffuse_shaders>` (it doesn't really "light" things).

Specular
   Prevents the lamp from producing :doc:`specular highlights </materials/properties/specular_shaders>`.
