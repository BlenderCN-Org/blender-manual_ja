Description
===========

The :guilabel:`Armature` modifier is used for building skeletal systems for animating the
poses of characters and anything else which needs to be posed.
With the :guilabel:`Vertex Group` and :guilabel:`Multi Modifier` options,
you can use several armatures to animate a single (mesh) object.

By adding an armature system to an object,
that object can be deformed accurately so that geometry doesn't have to be animated by hand.
The :guilabel:`Armature` modifier allows objects to be deformed by bones simply by specifying
the name of the armature object, without having to use the (old) "parent/child" system.

For more details on armatures usage, see :doc:`this chapter </rigging>`.

   Armature modifier


Object
   The name of the armature object used by this modifier.

   Preserve Volume
      Use quaternions for preserving volume of object during deformation. It can be better in many situations.
   Vertex Group
      The name of a vertex group of the object, the weights of which will be used to determine the influence of this :guilabel:`Armature` modifier's result when mixing it with the results from other :guilabel:`Armature` ones. Only meaningful when having at least two of these modifiers on the same object, with :guilabel:`Multi Modifier` activated.
   Multi Modifier
      Use the same data as a previous (:guilabel:`Armature` ?) modifier as input. This allows you to use several armatures to deform the same object, all based on the "non-deformed" data (i.e. this avoid having the second :guilabel:`Armature` modifier deform the result of the first one...). The results of the :guilabel:`Armature` modifiers are then mixed together, using the weights of the :guilabel:`VGroup` vertex groups as "mixing guides".

Bind To
   Method to bind the armature to the mesh.

   Vertex Groups
      Enable/Disable vertex groups defining the deformation (i.e. bones of a given name only deform vertices belonging to groups of same name).
   Bone Envelopes
      Enable/Disable bone envelopes defining the deformation (i.e. bones deform vertices in their neighborhood).
   Invert
      Inverts the influence set by the vertex group defined in previous setting (i.e. reverts the weight values of this group).
