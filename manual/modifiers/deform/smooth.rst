   Smooth modifier applied to a subdivided cube

   As above, with a vertex group selected


This modifier smooths a mesh by flattening the angles between adjacent faces in it,
just like :guilabel:`Smooth` in the :guilabel:`Editing` context.
It smooths without subdividing the mesh - the number of vertices remains the same.

This modifier is not limited to smoothing, though.
Its control factor can be configured outside the [\ ``0.0``, ``1.0`` ] range
(including negative values), which can result in interesting deformations,
depending on the affected mesh.


Options
=======

X, Y, Z
   Toggle buttons to enable/disable the modifier in the X, Y and/or Z axes directions.

Factor
   The factor to control the smoothing amount. The smoothing ranges from ``0.0`` to ``1.0`` (``0.0`` : disabled, ``0.5`` : same as the :guilabel:`Smooth` button, ``1.0`` : maximum). Alternatively, values outside this range (above ``1.0`` or below ``0.0``) distort the mesh.

Repeat
   The number of smoothing iterations, equivalent to pressing the :doc:`Smooth </ling/meshes/editing/deforming#smooth>` button multiple times.

Vertex Group
   A vertex group name, to restrict the effect to the vertices in it only. This allows for selective, real-time smoothing, by painting vertex weights.
