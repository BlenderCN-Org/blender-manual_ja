Skin Modifier

.. admonition:: Reference
   :class: refbox

   | Mode:     Any mode
   | Panel:    :guilabel:`Modifiers`


The :guilabel:`Skin` modifier uses vertices and edges to create a skinned surface,
using a per-vertex radius to better define the shape.

It is a quick way to generate base meshes for sculpting and/or smooth organic shapes with
arbitrary topology.

Note that faces in the input are ignored by the Skin modifier.

   Skin modifier UI.


Create Armature
   Create an armature for your object.
Branch Smoothing
   Smooth the intersection vertices.
Selected Vertices
   TODO
Mark Loose
   Mark the selected vertices as loosing points.
   Loosing defines points which merge their faces with each other to fill gaps.
Clear Loose
   Take the Loose away. The initial behavior.
Mark Root
   Defines the root points of the object. These are the center of the object.
Equalize Radii
   Makes the skin radii of selected vertices equal on each axis.


Example
=======

- Select the cube. :kbd:`Tab` into edit mode and :menuselection:`[Alt][M] --> At Center`
  to merge all vertices at one point. :kbd:`E` then :kbd:`Z` to extrude the vertex along the Z axis.

.. note:: Skin Node Set Flag

   One of the mesh's vertices must be set to :guilabel:`Root`.  If you by accident delete the default root vertex, select a vertex, hit the :guilabel:`Skin Node Set Flag` button, and in the :guilabel:`Mesh Tools` menu set the new vertex to root.


.. figure:: /images/Skin-header-00.jpg

   Simple creature, made with only the Skin modifier.


- In the modifiers' menu, add a :guilabel:`Skin` modifier.
- :kbd:`Tab` into edit mode and start extruding.  To see the actual "Z spheres", :kbd:`Z` to change to wireframe mode.  These spheres are actual meshes with a lot of polygons, so performance issues might occur on older computers.
- Try to get  sketch results similar to the picture (Simple creature, made with only the Skin modifier.), through extruding the vertices of the object.
- Use :kbd:`Ctrl-A` to change the size of the different regions within the creature.
- Use :guilabel:`Mark Loose` at regions like the neck, to merge these faces more together.
- To get smoother results, activate :guilabel:`Smooth Shading` and use :kbd:`Ctrl-3` on the object.
