   Default bevel.


The :guilabel:`Bevel` modifier adds the ability to bevel the edges of the mesh it is applied
to, allowing control of how and where the bevel is applied to the mesh.

The :guilabel:`Bevel` modifier is a non-destructive alternative to the
:doc:`Bevel Operation </modeling/meshes/editing/subdividing/bevel>` in mesh editing mode.

The picture *Unbeveled square* shows a square which has unbeveled edges as the angles

between the corners of the square are 90- (perpendicular).

The picture *Beveled square* shows a square which has beveled corners.

Although the two pictures show 2D squares,
the Blender :guilabel:`Bevel` modifier can work on both 2D and 3D meshes of almost any shape,
not just squares and cubes...

The picture *Default bevel* shows a Blender 3D cube with a bevel applied using just the
default :guilabel:`Bevel` modifier settings.


Options
=======

.. figure:: /images/Manual_CZ_BevelModifier_None_IF.jpg

   Bevel modifier panel.


Width
-----

The :guilabel:`Width` numeric field controls the width/amount of the bevel applied to the base
mesh. It can range from ``0.0`` (no bevel applied) to ``1.0`` (Blender Units).
This value is in fact the "backing up" of the two new edges relatively to the original
(beveled) one, along the two concerned faces.


.. note::

   When using Metric or Imperial units the :guilabel:`Width` value has a unit.
   E.g. when 1 Blenderunit is 1m a useful value is between 0cm and 100cm.
   When it seems that decreasing the :guilabel:`Width` has no effect
   anymore check if the unit changed to m instead of cm.

   :figwidth: 610px

   Three Cubes with 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 bevel Widths.


Segments
--------

Set the number of bevel segments for round edges/verts.


Only Vertices
-------------

The :guilabel:`Only Vertices` button alters the way in which a bevel is applied to the mesh.
When it is active, only the areas near vertices are beveled; the edges are left unbeveled.

   :width: 610px
   :figwidth: 610px

   Three cubes with 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5' bevel Widths, with Only Vertices option enabled.


Limit Method
------------

This section of the :guilabel:`Bevel` modifier is used to control where and when a bevel is
applied to the underlying mesh. The first row of three buttons (mutually exclusive)
controls the algorithm used, and might add some extra options.

None
   This button will apply the :guilabel:`Bevel` modifier to the whole underlying mesh,
   without any way to prevent the bevel on some edges/vertices.


.. figure:: /images/Manual_CZ_BevelModifier_Angle_IF.jpg

   Bevel modifier with the Angle limit enabled.


Angle
   This button will only bevel edges where faces make sharp angles. When selected,
   it displays the :guilabel:`Angle` numeric field, used to set the angle above which an edge will be beveled
   (it is in fact the complementary angle, i.e. ``180 - (angle between faces)``).
   When the angle between meeting faces is less than the angle in the slider box,
   a bevel on those specific edges will not be applied. Similarly,
   when the angle between two edges is less than this limit, the vertex is not beveled.



.. figure:: /images/Manual_CZ_BevelModifier_Weight_IF.jpg

   Bevel modifier with Weight button active.


Weight
   Use bevel weights to determine how much bevel is applied; apply them separately in vert/edge select mode.
   See :doc:`Here </modeling/meshes/editing/edges>` about adjusting bevel weights.
   The three options specify what edge weight to use for weighting a vertex.

   Average
      Uses the average bevel weight at the vertex
   Sharpest
      Uses the smallest bevel weight at the vertex
   Largest
      Uses the largest bevel weight at the vertex
Vertex Group
   Use a vertex group to determine which parts of the mesh get beveled.
