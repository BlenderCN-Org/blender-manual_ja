   Multires modifier


The :guilabel:`Multiresolution` modifier gives the ability to subdivide a mesh to different
levels depending on whether you are viewing it from the 3D Viewport,
Sculpt Mode or a Blender Render.


Options
=======

Catmull-Clark / Simple
   Set the type of subdivision. :guilabel:`Simple` maintains the current shape, and simply subdivides edges. :guilabel:`Catmull-Clark` creates a smooth surface, smaller than the original.
Preview
   Set the level of subdivisions to use in the viewport.
Sculpt
   Set the number of subdivisions to use in :guilabel:`Sculpt Mode`.
Render
   Set the number of subdivisions to use when rendering.

Subdivide
   Add a higher level of subdivision.
Delete Higher
   Deletes all subdivision levels that are higher than the current one.
Reshape
   Copies vertex coordinates from another mesh. To use, select a different mesh with matching topology and vertex coordinates, then :kbd:`Shift` select the mesh and click :guilabel:`Reshape`. The mesh will take the shape of the other one.
Apply Base
   Modifies the mesh to match the form of the subdivided mesh.

Optimal Display
   Skips the drawing of edges added from subdivision.

Save External
   Saves displacements to an external .btx file.
