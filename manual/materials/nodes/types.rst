Types of Material Nodes
***********************

This section is organized by type of node, which are grouped based on similar functions:


- :doc:`Input </materials/nodes/types/input>` - Introduces a material or component to the node map.
- :doc:`Output </materials/nodes/types/output>` - Displays the result in progress as a small image.
- :doc:`Color </materials/nodes/types/color>` - Manipulates the colors of the material.
- :doc:`Vector </materials/nodes/types/vector>` - Change the way light is reflected off the material.
- :doc:`Convertors </materials/nodes/types/convertor>` - Convert colors to other material colors.
- :doc:`Groups </materials/nodes/node_groups>` - User-defined groups of nodes.
- :doc:`Dynamic </materials/nodes/types/dynamic>` - Custom nodes defined by Python. These are also known as PyNodes.
