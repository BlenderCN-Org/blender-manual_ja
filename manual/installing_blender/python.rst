`Python <http://www.python.org>`__ is an interpreted programming language used in Blender as our main
general purpose scripting language.

Python can be used to extend the functionality of Blender through its Python API.
Blender comes bundled with the appropriate Python libraries, so for regular usage a full install of
Python is not required to run Python scripts.

Users wanting to :doc:`write their own scripts </extensions/python>`, or use some less common features may
still need a full Python install.
