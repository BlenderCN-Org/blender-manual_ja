Installing on Windows
*********************

Download
========

You can obtain the latest stable version of Blender for Windows from the
`Blender download page <http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/>`__.


Version
=======

Blender for Windows is currently available in 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
Users with a 32-bit version of Windows must download the 32-bit version of Blender. Users with
a 64-bit version of Windows can choose to use either the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Blender,
however you will likely notice an increase in performance when using the 64-bit version of
Blender, especially on systems with large amounts of RAM.

To identify whether your Windows Vista or Windows 7 computer is 32- or 64-bit, you can:


- Click the Windows Icon start button, right click the **Computer** options and then click **Properties**.
- The system type (32- or 64-bit) will be displayed under the **System** option.

If you are using Windows XP:


- Click **Start**.
- Right-click **My Computer**
- Click **Properties.**
- If you are using the 64-bit version of Windows XP, *x64 Edition* will be displayed under the **System** option.


Installation
============

Once your download has finished, navigate to the *Downloads* folder and double-click the
Blender executable file to start the installation process.
Keep in mind that installing Blender requires Administrator rights.

And there you go! A fresh installation of Blender 2.5. After enabling or disabling
 the option to run Blender right after closing the installation, click 'Finish'.


Portable Install
================

If you want to run Blender off a USB key so that you can use it wherever you go,
download the .zip version and extract it to a USB key. You may want to avoid storing animation
output or other temporary files on the USB key as frequent drive writes may shorten its life.

To keep all configuration files and installed addons on the USB key,
create a folder named *config* in the unzipped Blender folder. Now all configuration files
will be read from and written to the USB key rather than the computer you're running Blender
on.
