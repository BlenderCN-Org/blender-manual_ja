Installing on Mac
*****************

Installing Blender on a Mac is very easy.
There are pre-compiled versions for 32 and 64 Bit Macs using Intel Processors.
Once you know your platform and processor :

- Download the appropriate Blender version for your system from `blender.org download page <http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/>`__
- Right click on the downloaded file, choose *Unzip to a Folder*.
- A folder where you downloaded Blender will be created, with the same name of the downloaded file, without extension.
- Click in the folder, it will be opened in Finder (See Fig: Opening Blender From Finder - Below)
- Click twice on the *blender.app* file. You're ready to go!

   Opening Blender from Finder - Example using Blender 2.61 for a 64 bit Intel Mac, Mac OSX 10.6

.. tip::
   Since 2.63, we have no more pre-compiled versions for PPCs G5 (PowerMacs).
   Blender 2.64x and above will only run on Macs using Intel processors, Mac OSX 10.6 or higher is required.

**Important:** If you need to run Blender from a Command Line to see the Console Window, visit the page about the :doc:`Blender Console Window </interface/window_system/console_window>`

==============================

   Places and *Applications* on Mac

You can move Blender to the *Applications* folder, and it will work like any other application in your Mac.
You can do this by copying or moving the unzipped folder to the *Applications* folder.
