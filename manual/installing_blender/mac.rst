   Since 2.63, we have no more pre-compiled versions for PPCs G5 (PowerMacs).
   Blender 2.64 Versions and above will only run on Macs using Intel processors, Mac OS X 10.6 or higher is required.


**Important:** If you need to run Blender from a Command Line to see the Console Window, visit the page about the :doc:`Blender Console Window </interface/window_system/console_window>`
