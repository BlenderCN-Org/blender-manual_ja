"Getting to know Blender and learning Computer Graphics (CG) as an art are "

"The first, or conceptual understanding, is learned by taking courses in art "
"and media, by reading books, and by trial and error. Once you have the "
"conceptual knowledge, you can easily learn Blender (or any other CG "
"package). Learning both at the same time is difficult, since you are dealing"
" with two issues, but not impossible. In this manual, the conceptual "
"knowledge is usually addressed in a short paragraph or two at the beginning "
"of a topic or chapter that explains the topic and provides a workflow, or "
"process, for accomplishing the task. The rest of the manual section "
"addresses the specific capabilities and features of Blender with regard to "
"that task. The user manual cannot give you the full conceptual knowledge - "
"that comes from other sources (books, practice, etc.). You can use Blender "
"to create a feature film, but reading this manual and using Blender won't "

"In 1988 Ton Roosendaal co-founded the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo. NeoGeo "
"quickly became the largest 3D animation studio in the Netherlands and one of"
" the leading animation houses in Europe. NeoGeo created award-winning "
"productions (European Corporate Video Awards 1993 and 1995) for large "
"corporate clients such as multi-national electronics company Philips. Within"
" NeoGeo Ton was responsible for both art direction and internal software "
"development. After careful deliberation Ton decided that the current in-"
"house 3D toolset for NeoGeo was too old and cumbersome to maintain, and "
"needed to be rewritten from scratch. In 1995 this rewrite began and was "
"destined to become the 3D software creation we all know as Blender. As "
"NeoGeo continued to refine and improve Blender it became apparent to Ton "
"that Blender could be used as a tool for other artists outside of NeoGeo."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/introduction/history.rst:18
msgid ""
"In 1998, Ton decided to found a new company called Not a Number (NaN) as a "
"spin-off of NeoGeo to further market and develop Blender. At the core of NaN"
" was a desire to create and distribute a compact, cross platform 3D "
"application for free. At the time this was a revolutionary concept as most "
"commercial 3D applications cost thousands of dollars. NaN hoped to bring "
"professional level 3D modeling and animation tools within the reach of the "
"general computing public. NaN's business model involved providing commercial"
" products and services around Blender. In 1999 NaN attended its first "
"SIGGRAPH conference in an effort to more widely promote Blender. Blender's "
"first SIGGRAPH convention was a huge success and gathered a tremendous "
"amount of interest from both the press and attendees. Blender was a hit and "
"its huge potential confirmed!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/introduction/history.rst:30
msgid ""
"Following the success of the SIGGRAPH conference in early 2000, NaN secured "
"financing of â‚¬4.5M from venture capitalists. This large inflow of cash "
"enabled NaN to rapidly expand its operations. Soon NaN boasted as many as "
"fifty employees working around the world trying to improve and promote "
"Blender. In the summer of 2000, Blender 2.0 was released. This version of "
"Blender added the integration of a game engine to the 3D application. By the"
" end of 2000, the number of users registered on the NaN website surpassed "
"250,000."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/introduction/history.rst:37
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, NaN's ambitions and opportunities didn't match the company's "
"capabilities and the market realities of the time. This over-extension "
"resulted in restarting NaN with new investor funding and a smaller company "
"in April 2001. Six months later NaN's first commercial software product, "
"Blender Publisher was launched. This product was targeted at the emerging "
"market of interactive web-based 3D media. Due to disappointing sales and the"
" ongoing difficult economic climate, the new investors decided to shut down "
"all NaN operations. The shutdown also included discontinuing the development"
" of Blender. Although there were clearly shortcomings in the then current "
"version of Blender, such as a complex internal software architecture, "
"unfinished features and a non-standard way of providing the GUI, the "
"enthusiastic support from the user community and customers who had purchased"
" Blender Publisher in the past meant that Ton couldn't justify leaving "
"Blender to fade into insignificance. Since restarting a company with a "
"sufficiently large team of developers wasn't feasible, Ton Roosendaal "
"founded the non-profit organization Blender Foundation in March 2002."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/introduction/history.rst:53
msgid ""
"The Blender Foundation's primary goal was to find a way to continue "
"developing and promoting Blender as a community-based `open source "
"<http://www.opensource.org/>`__ project. In July 2002, Ton managed to get "
"the NaN investors to agree to a unique Blender Foundation plan to attempt to"
" release Blender as open source. The \"Free Blender\" campaign sought to "
"raise â‚¬100,000 so that the Foundation could buy the rights to the Blender "
"source code and intellectual property rights from the NaN investors and "
"subsequently release Blender to the open source community. With an "
"enthusiastic group of volunteers, among them several ex-NaN employees, a "
"fund raising campaign was launched to \"Free Blender\". To everyone's "
"surprise and delight the campaign reached the â‚¬100,000 goal in only seven "
"short weeks. On Sunday October 13, 2002, Blender was released to the world "
"under the terms of the `GNU GPL <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl>`__. "
"Blender development continues to this day driven by a team of dedicated "
"volunteers from around the world led by Blender's original creator, Ton "
"Roosendaal."

"Blender was first conceived in December 1993 and became a usable product in "
"August 1994 as an integrated application that enables the creation of a "
"diverse range of 2D and 3D content. Blender provides a broad spectrum of "
"functionality in one package. Through its open architecture, Blender "
"provides cross-platform interoperability, extensibility, an incredibly small"
" memory and disk footprint, and a tightly integrated workflow. Blender is "
"perhaps the most popular open source 3D graphics applications in the world."

"When one hears about \"free software\", the first thing that comes to mind "
"might be \"no cost\". While this is true in most cases, the term \"free "
"software\" as used by the Free Software Foundation (originators of the GNU "
"Project and creators of the GNU General Public License) is intended to mean "
"\"free as in freedom\" rather than the \"no cost\" sense (which is usually "
"referred to as \"free as in free beer\"). Free software in this sense is "
"software which you are free to use, copy, modify, redistribute, with no "
"limit. Contrast this with the licensing of most commercial software "
"packages, where you are allowed to load the software on a single computer, "
"are allowed to make no copies, and never see the source code. Free software "
"allows incredible freedom to the end user. Since the source code is "
"universally available, there are also many more chances for bugs to be "
