"Dealing with different sized images and different sized outputs is tricky. "
"Think like a pixel. If you have a mis-match between the size of the input "
"image and the render output size, the VSE does try to auto-scale the image "
"to fit it entirely in the output. This may result in clipping. If you do not"
" want that, use Crop and/or Offset in the Input panel to move and select a "
"region of the image within the output. When you use Crop or Offset, the "
"auto-scaling will be disabled and you can manually re-scale by adding the "
"Transform effect."
