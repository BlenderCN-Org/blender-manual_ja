"When Blender carries out operations that require extra memory (RAM), it "
"calls a function called malloc (short for memory allocate) which tries to "
"allocate a requested amount of memory for Blender. If this cannot be "
"satisfied, malloc will return nil/null/0 to indicate that it failed to carry"
" out the request. If this happens Blender will not be able to carry out the "
"operation requested by the user. This will most likely result in Blender "
"operating very slowly or shutting down. If you want to avoid running out of "
"memory you can install more memory in your system, reduce the amount of "
"detail in your Blender models, or shut down other programs and services "
"which may be taking up memory that Blender could use."
