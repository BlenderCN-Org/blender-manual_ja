"Environment maps take a render of the 3D scene and apply it to a texture, to"
" use for faking reflections. If you want to achieve a very realistic result,"
" raytraced reflections are a good solution. Environment Maps are another way"
" to create reflective surfaces, but they are not so simple to set up."

"The main reason is probably that they can be much faster than raytracing "
"reflections. In certain situations they need to be calculated only once, and"
" may be reused like any ordinary texture. You may even modify the "
"precalculated Environment Map in an image editor."
msgstr ""

"Environment maps can also be blurred and render even faster because the "

"Just as we render the light that reaches the viewing plane using the camera "
"to define a viewpoint, we can render the light that reaches the surface of "
"an object (and hence, the light that might ultimately be reflected to the "
"camera). Blender's environment mapping renders a cubic image map of the "
"scene in the six cardinal directions from any point. When the six tiles of "
"the image are mapped onto an object using the :guilabel:`Refl` input "
"coordinates, they create the visual complexity that the eye expects to see "
"from shiny reflections."

"It's useful to remember here that the true goal of this technique is "
