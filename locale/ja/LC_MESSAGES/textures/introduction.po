"In CGI, texture mapping is a method to add detail to surfaces by projecting "
"images and patterns onto those surfaces. The projected images and patterns "
"can be set to affect not only color, but also specularity, reflection, "
"transparency, and even fake 3-dimensional depth.  Most often, the images and"
" patterns are projected during render time, but texture mapping is also used"
" to sculpt, paint and deform objects."

"This notion of using *more than one* texture, to achieve a combined effect, "
"is one of the \"hidden secrets\" of creating realistic-looking objects. If "
"you carefully \"look at the light\" while examining any real-life object, "
"you will observe that the final appearance of that object is best described "
"as the combination, in different ways and in different amounts, of several "
"distinct underlying visual characteristics. These characteristics might be "
"more (or less) strongly apparent at different angles, under different "
"lighting conditions, and so forth. Blender allows you to achieve this in "
"many ways. You can use \"a stack of texture layers\" as described in "
":doc:`this section </textures/options>`, or you can also use arbitrarily-"
"complex networks (\"noodles\"...) of \"texture nodes\" as discussed "
":doc:`here </textures/types/nodes>`; the choice is yours."
