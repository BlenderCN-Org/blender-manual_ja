"Procedural textures are textures that are defined mathematically. They are "
"generally relatively simple to use, because they don't need to be mapped in "
"a special way - which doesn't mean that procedural textures can't become "
"very complex."

"These types of textures are 'real' 3D. By that we mean that they fit "
"together perfectly at the edges and continue to look like what they are "
"meant to look like even when they are cut; as if a block of wood had really "
"been cut in two. Procedural textures are not filtered or anti-aliased. This "
"is hardly ever a problem: the user can easily keep the specified frequencies"
" within acceptable limits."

"Procedural textures can either produce colored textures, intensity only "

" intensity value, you have to switch on :guilabel:`No RGB` in the "
":guilabel:`Mapping` panel."
