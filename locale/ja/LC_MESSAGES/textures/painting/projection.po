"Painting on a 3D model requires some setup before being possible. Blender "
"needs a way to map an image to the 3D model. This is accomplished by using a"
" UV map (see :doc:`UV Mapping </textures/mapping/uv>` for more details), so "
"if the model hasn't been unwrapped yet, it should be unwrapped prior to "
"entering *Texture Paint* mode. The image assigned to the UV layer is also "
"used for painting. That means that the user should either:"
