msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Track To` constraint applies rotations to its owner, so that "
"it always points a given \"To\" axis towards its target, with another \"Up\""
" axis permanently maintained as much aligned with the global Z axis (by "
"default) as possible. This tracking is similar to the \"billboard tracking\""
" in 3D (see note below)."

"This is the preferred tracking constraint, as it has a more easily "
"controlled constraining mechanism."

"This constraint shares a close relationship to the :doc:`Inverse Kinematics "
"constraint </constraints/tracking/ik_solver>` in some ways. It is very "
"important in rig design, and you should be sure to read and understand the "
":doc:`2.49 BSoD tracking tutorial </ls/animation/armatures/bsod/tracking>`, "
"as it centers around the use of both of these constraints."

"The term \"billboard\" has a specific meaning in real-time CG programming "
"(i.e. video games!), where it is used for plane objects always facing the "
"camera (they are indeed \"trackers\", the camera being their \"target\"). "
"Their main usage is as support for tree or mist textures: if they were not "
"permanently facing the camera, you would often see your trees squeezing to "
"nothing, or your mist turning into a millefeuille paste, which would be "
"funny but not so credible."
