"The :guilabel:`Spline IK` constraint aligns a chain of bones along a curve. "
"By leveraging the ease and flexibility of achieving aesthetically pleasing "
"shapes offered by curves and the predictability and well-integrated control "
"offered by bones, :guilabel:`Spline IK` is an invaluable tool in the "
"riggers' toolbox. It is particularly well suited for rigging flexible body "
"parts such as tails, tentacles, and spines, as well as inorganic items such "
"as ropes."
