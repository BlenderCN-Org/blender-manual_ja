msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Stretch To` constraint causes its owner to rotate and scale "
"its Y axis towards its target. So it has the same tracking behavior as the "
":doc:`Track To constraint </constraints/tracking/track_to>`. However, it "
"assumes that the Y axis will be the tracking and stretching axis, and "
"doesn't give you the option of using a different one."

#: ../../manual/constraints/tracking/stretch_to.rst:13
msgid ""
"It also optionally has some raw volumetric features, so the owner can squash"
" down as the target moves closer, or thin out as the target moves farther "
"away. Note however that it is not the real volume of the owner which is thus"
" preserved, but rather the virtual one defined by its scale values. Hence, "
"this feature works even with non-volumetric objects, like empties, 2D meshes"
" or surfaces, and curves."

"With bones, the \"volumetric\" variation scales them along their own local "
"axes (remember that the local Y axis of a bone is aligned with it, from root"
