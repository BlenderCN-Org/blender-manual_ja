"It also optionally has some raw volumetric features, so the owner can squash"
" down as the target moves closer, or thin out as the target moves farther "
"away. Note however that it is not the real volume of the owner which is thus"
" preserved, but rather the virtual one defined by its scale values. Hence, "
"this feature works even with non-volumetric objects, like empties, 2D meshes"
" or surfaces, and curves."
