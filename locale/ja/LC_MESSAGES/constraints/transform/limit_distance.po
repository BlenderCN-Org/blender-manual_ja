"The :guilabel:`Limit Distance` constraint forces its owner to stay either "
"further from, nearer to, or exactly at a given distance from its target. In "
"other words, the owner's location is constrained either outside, inside, or "
"at the surface of a sphere centered on its target."

"When you specify a (new) target, the :guilabel:`Distance` value is "
"automatically set to correspond to the distance between the owner and this "
"target."

"Note that if you use such a constraint on a *connected* bone, it will have "
"no effect, as it is the parent's tip which controls the position of your "
"owner bone's root."
