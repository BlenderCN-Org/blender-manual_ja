msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Floor` constraint allows you to use its target position (and "
"optionally rotation) to specify a plane with a \"forbidden side\", where the"
" owner cannot go. This plane can have any orientation you like. In other "
"words, it creates a floor (or a ceiling, or a wall)! Note that it is only "
"capable of simulating entirely flat planes, even if you use the "
":guilabel:`Vertex Group` option. It cannot be used for uneven floors or "
"walls."

"This set of (mutually exclusive) buttons controls which plane will be the "
"\"floor\". The buttons' names correspond indeed to the *normal* to this "
"plane (e.g. enabling :guilabel:`Z` means \"XY plane\", etc.) By default, "
"these normals are aligned with the *global* axes. However, if you enable "
":guilabel:`Use Rotation` (see above), they will be aligned with the *local "
"target's axes*. As the constraint does not only define an uncrossable plane,"
" but also a side of it which is forbidden to the owner, you can choose which"
" side by enabling either the positive or negative normal axis... E.g, by "
"default (:guilabel:`Z`), the owner is stuck in the positive Z coordinates."
