"A material defines the artistic qualities of the substance that an object is"
" made of. In its simplest form, you can use materials to show the substance "
"an object is made of, or to \"paint\" the object with different colors. "
"Usually, the substance is represented by its surface qualities (color, "
"shininess, reflectance, etc.) but it can also exhibit more complicated "
"effects such as transparency, diffraction and sub-surface scattering. "
"Typical  materials might be brass, skin, glass, or linen."

"The basic (un-textured) Blender  material is uniform across each face of an "
"object (although the various pixels of each face of the object may appear "
"differently because of lighting effects). However, different faces of the "
"object may use different materials (see :doc:`Multiple Materials "
"</materials/multiple_materials>`)."

"In Blender, materials can (optionally) have associated textures. Textures "

":guilabel:`dirty` glass or :guilabel:`embroidered` linen. The :doc:`Textures"
" </textures>` chapter describes how to add textures to materials."

"Before you can understand how to design effectively with materials, you must"
" understand how simulated light and surfaces interact in Blender's rendering"
" engine and how material settings control those interactions. A deep "
"understanding of the engine will help you to get the most from it."

"The rendered image you create with Blender is a projection of the scene onto"
" an imaginary surface called the *viewing plane*. The viewing plane is "
"analogous to the film in a traditional camera, or the rods and cones in the "
"human eye, except that it receives simulated light, not real light."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/materials/introduction.rst:46
msgid ""
"To render an image of a scene we must first determine what light from the "
"scene is arriving at each point on the viewing plane. The best way to answer"
" this question is to follow a straight line (the simulated light ray) "
"backwards through that point on the viewing plane and the focal point (the "
"location of the camera) until it hits a renderable surface in the scene, at "
"which point we can determine what light would strike that point."

"The surface properties and incident light angle tell us how much of that "

"Two basic types of phenomena take place at any point on a surface when a "
"light ray strikes it: diffusion and specular reflection. Diffusion and "
"specular reflection are distinguished from each other mainly by the "
"relationship between the incident light angle and the reflected light angle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/materials/introduction.rst:67
msgid ""
"The shading (or coloring) of the object during render will then take into "
"account the base color (as modified by the diffusion and specular reflection"
" phenomenon) and the light intensity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/materials/introduction.rst:71
msgid ""
"Using the internal ray tracer, other (more advanced) phenomena could occur. "
"In ray-traced reflections, the point of a surface struck by a light ray will"
" return the color of its surrounding environment, according to the rate of "
"reflection of the material (mixing the base color and the surrounding "
"environment's) and the viewing angle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/materials/introduction.rst:76
msgid ""
"On the other hand, in ray-traced refractions, the point of a surface struck "
"by a light ray will return the color of its background environment, "
"according to the rate of transparency (mixing the base color and the "
"background environment's along with its optional filtering value) of the "
"material and the optional index of refraction of the material, which will "
"distort the viewing angle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/materials/introduction.rst:82

"Of course, shading of the object hit by a light ray will be about mixing all"
" these phenomena at the same time during the rendering. The appearance of "

"As stated above, the material settings usually determine the surface "

"The exact effect of Material settings can be affected by a number of system "
"settings. First and foremost is the Render Engine used - Cycles and the "
"Blender Render Engine (aka Blender Internal or BI) require quite different "
"illumination levels to achieve similar results, and even then the appearance"
" of objects can be quite different. Also, the material properties settings "
"can be affected by the texture method used (Single Texture, Multitexture or "
"GLSL). So it is recommended to always select the appropriate system settings"
" before starting the design of materials."
