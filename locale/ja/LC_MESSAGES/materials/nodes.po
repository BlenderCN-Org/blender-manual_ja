"In addition to creating materials as just described using all the settings "
"on all the materials panels, Blender allows you to create a material by "
"routing basic materials through a set of nodes. Each node performs some "
"operation on the material, changing how it will appear when applied to the "
"mesh, and passes it on to the next node. In this way, very complex material "
"appearances can be achieved."

"You should already be familiar with general material concepts and how to "
"create materials/textures using the material menu. You should also have a "
"general understanding of the texture coordinate systems available in Blender"
" (e.g. Generated, UV, etc.). Also, many aspects of a node will be skipped "
"here because in later sections you will see the function expanded upon. Each"
" section builds off the previous."

"To start, the node system does not make the material menu obsolete. Many "
"features and material settings are still only accessible through the "
"material panel (e.g. Ray Mirror). However with the advent of nodes, more "
"complex and fantastic materials can be created since we now have greater "
"control."

"Just in case you're not (yet) familiar with the concepts:  when you create a"
" system of nodes (otherwise known as a \"noodle\"), you're describing a "
"data-processing pipeline of sorts, where data \"flows from\" nodes which "
"describe various *sources,* \"flows through\" nodes which represent various "
"processing and filtering stages, and finally \"flows into\" nodes which "
"represent outputs or destinations. You can connect the nodes to one another "
"in many different ways, and you can adjust \"knobs, \" or parameters, that "
"control the behavior of each node. This gives you a tremendous amount of "
"creative control.  And, it will very quickly become intuitive."

"Here we have the standard material we have added to a cube mesh. We could, "
"as we have in the past, add color and other settings to this material and it"
" would certainly look nice. But let's say we are just not getting what we "
"are looking for? What if we want to control the creation more tightly or add"
" more complexity? Here is where nodes come in."
