"Many organic and inorganic materials are not totally opaque right at the "
"surface, so light does not just bounce off the top surface. Instead, some "
"light also penetrates the skin surface deeply, and scatters around inside, "
"taking on the color of the insides and emerging back out at a different "
"location. Human/animal skin, the skin of grapes, tomatoes, fruits, wax, gels"
" (like honey, or Jello) and so on all have subsurface scattering (SSS), and "
"photo-realism really cannot be achieved without it."

"In the second step, the final image is rendered, but now the SSS shader "
"replaces the diffuse shader. Instead of the lamps, the calculated lightmap "
"is used. The brightness of a surface point is the calculated \"Average\" of "
"the brightness of its surrounding points. Depending on your settings the "

"This is not in fact the radius of the subsurface scattering, but the average"

"This value corresponds to the average length the light travels between each "
"bounce.  The longer the path length is, the further the light is allowed to "
"scatter. This is the main source of a material's perceived \"scatter "
"color.\" A material like skin will have a higher red radius than green and "
"blue. Subsurface scattering is the diffusion of light beneath the surface. "
