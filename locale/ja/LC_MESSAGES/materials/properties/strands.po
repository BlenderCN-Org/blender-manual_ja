"**Polygon strands:** This is the default (old) method. The strands are "

":guilabel:`Steps` settings in the :guilabel:`Render` panel of the "
":guilabel:`Object` context, :guilabel:`Particles` sub-context."

"**Strand Primitive:** You activate Strand Primitive with the button "
":guilabel:`Strand render` in the :guilabel:`Render` panel of the particle "
"system. The hair curves are not stored as polygons; only the key points are "
"stored, which are then converted to polygons on the fly. A second difference"
" is the way transparency works. Rather than rendering using the existing "
"system, all strand segments in a part are sorted front to back and rendered "
"in that order."

"Are more memory efficient and faster, to make rendering of large amounts of "
"fur and grass possible. For good performance, the render steps button should"
" be lowered (e.g. 2 should be good enough fur), since the result will be a "
"smoothed curve anyway. You need 1 to 2 render steps less than steps in the "
"3D window. Also, using more render parts helps to reduce memory usage."
