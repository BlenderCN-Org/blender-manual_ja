"In many real life situations — like skin or metals — the color of diffuse "
"and specular reflections can differ slightly, based on the amount of energy "
"a surface receives or on the light angle of incidence. The :guilabel:`Ramp "
"Shader` options in Blender allow you to set a range of colors for a "
":guilabel:`Material`, and define how the range will vary over a surface, and"
" how it blends with the 'actual color' (typically from a material or as "
"output of a texture)."

"Ramps allow you to precisely control the color gradient across a material, "
"rather than just a simple blend from a brightened color to a darkened color,"
" from the most strongly lit area to the darkest lit area. As well as several"
" options for controlling the gradient from lit to shadowed, ramps also "
"provide 'normal' input, to define a gradient from surfaces facing the camera"
" to surfaces facing away from the camera. This is often used for materials "
"like some types of metallic car paint that change color based on viewing "
"angle."

"Since texture calculations in Blender happen before shading, the "
":guilabel:`Ramp Shader` can completely replace texture or material color. "
"But by use of the mixing options and Alpha values it is possible to create "
"an additional layer of shading in Blender materials."
