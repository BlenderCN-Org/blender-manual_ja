"Ramps allow you to precisely control the color gradient across a material, "
"rather than just a simple blend from a brightened color to a darkened color,"
" from the most strongly lit area to the darkest lit area. As well as several"
" options for controlling the gradient from lit to shadowed, ramps also "
"provide 'normal' input, to define a gradient from surfaces facing the camera"
" to surfaces facing away from the camera. This is often used for materials "
"like some types of metallic car paint that change color based on viewing "
"angle."
