"In 1988 Ton Roosendaal co-founded the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo. NeoGeo "
"quickly became the largest 3D animation studio in the Netherlands and one of"
" the leading animation houses in Europe. NeoGeo created award-winning "
"productions (European Corporate Video Awards 1993 and 1995) for large "
"corporate clients such as multi-national electronics company Philips. Within"
" NeoGeo Ton was responsible for both art direction and internal software "
"development. After careful deliberation Ton decided that the current in-"
"house 3D toolset for NeoGeo was too old and cumbersome to maintain, and "
"needed to be rewritten from scratch. In 1995 this rewrite began and was "
"destined to become the 3D software creation we all know as Blender. As "
"NeoGeo continued to refine and improve Blender it became apparent to Ton "
"that Blender could be used as a tool for other artists outside of NeoGeo."

#: ../../manual/introduction/history.rst:18
msgid ""
"In 1998, Ton decided to found a new company called Not a Number (NaN) as a "
"spin-off of NeoGeo to further market and develop Blender. At the core of NaN"
" was a desire to create and distribute a compact, cross platform 3D "
"application for free. At the time this was a revolutionary concept as most "
"commercial 3D applications cost thousands of dollars. NaN hoped to bring "
"professional level 3D modeling and animation tools within the reach of the "
"general computing public. NaN's business model involved providing commercial"
" products and services around Blender. In 1999 NaN attended its first "
"SIGGRAPH conference in an effort to more widely promote Blender. Blender's "
"first SIGGRAPH convention was a huge success and gathered a tremendous "
"amount of interest from both the press and attendees. Blender was a hit and "
"its huge potential confirmed!"

"Following the success of the SIGGRAPH conference in early 2000, NaN secured "
"financing of €4.5M from venture capitalists. This large inflow of cash "
"enabled NaN to rapidly expand its operations. Soon NaN boasted as many as "
"fifty employees working around the world trying to improve and promote "
"Blender. In the summer of 2000, Blender 2.0 was released. This version of "
"Blender added the integration of a game engine to the 3D application. By the"
" end of 2000, the number of users registered on the NaN website surpassed "
"250,000."

"Unfortunately, NaN's ambitions and opportunities didn't match the company's "
"capabilities and the market realities of the time. This over-extension "
"resulted in restarting NaN with new investor funding and a smaller company "
"in April 2001. Six months later NaN's first commercial software product, "
"Blender Publisher was launched. This product was targeted at the emerging "
"market of interactive web-based 3D media. Due to disappointing sales and the"
" ongoing difficult economic climate, the new investors decided to shut down "
"all NaN operations. The shutdown also included discontinuing the development"
" of Blender. Although there were clearly shortcomings in the then current "
"version of Blender, such as a complex internal software architecture, "
"unfinished features and a non-standard way of providing the GUI, the "
"enthusiastic support from the user community and customers who had purchased"
" Blender Publisher in the past meant that Ton couldn't justify leaving "
"Blender to fade into insignificance. Since restarting a company with a "

" release Blender as open source. The \"Free Blender\" campaign sought to "
"raise €100,000 so that the Foundation could buy the rights to the Blender "
"source code and intellectual property rights from the NaN investors and "
"subsequently release Blender to the open source community. With an "
"enthusiastic group of volunteers, among them several ex-NaN employees, a "
"fund raising campaign was launched to \"Free Blender\". To everyone's "
"surprise and delight the campaign reached the €100,000 goal in only seven "
