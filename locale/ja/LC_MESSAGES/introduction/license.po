"When one hears about \"free software\", the first thing that comes to mind "
"might be \"no cost\". While this is true in most cases, the term \"free "
"software\" as used by the Free Software Foundation (originators of the GNU "
"Project and creators of the GNU General Public License) is intended to mean "
"\"free as in freedom\" rather than the \"no cost\" sense (which is usually "
"referred to as \"free as in free beer\"). Free software in this sense is "
"software which you are free to use, copy, modify, redistribute, with no "
"limit. Contrast this with the licensing of most commercial software "
"packages, where you are allowed to load the software on a single computer, "
"are allowed to make no copies, and never see the source code. Free software "
"allows incredible freedom to the end user. Since the source code is "
"universally available, there are also many more chances for bugs to be "
"caught and fixed."
