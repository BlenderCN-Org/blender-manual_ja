"Getting to know Blender and learning Computer Graphics (CG) as an art are "

"The first, or conceptual understanding, is learned by taking courses in art "
"and media, by reading books, and by trial and error. Once you have the "
"conceptual knowledge, you can easily learn Blender (or any other CG "
"package). Learning both at the same time is difficult, since you are dealing"
" with two issues, but not impossible. In this manual, the conceptual "
"knowledge is usually addressed in a short paragraph or two at the beginning "
"of a topic or chapter that explains the topic and provides a workflow, or "
"process, for accomplishing the task. The rest of the manual section "
"addresses the specific capabilities and features of Blender with regard to "
"that task. The user manual cannot give you the full conceptual knowledge - "
"that comes from other sources (books, practice, etc.). You can use Blender "
"to create a feature film, but reading this manual and using Blender won't "
"make you another Steven Spielberg!"

#~ " is deeply applicable along the Duration and Integration scales. From a "

#~ "*Introducing Character Animation With Blender* addresses using CG models "
#~ "deformed by Armatures and shapes to produce a one-minute animation. Using "
#~ "Blender fluids in a TV production/commercial is at the Shape/Sim-Integrated-"
#~ "Minute intersection. Elephants Dream and Big Buck Bunny is a bubble at the "
