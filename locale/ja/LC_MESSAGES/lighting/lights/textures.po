"When a new lamp is added, it produces light in a uniform, flat color. While "
"this might be sufficient in simple renderings, more sophisticated effects "
"can be accomplished through the use of :doc:`textures </textures>`. Subtle "
"textures can add visual nuance to a lamp, while hard textures can be used to"
" simulate more pronounced effects, such as a disco ball, dappled sunlight "
"breaking through treetops, or even a projector. These textures are assigned "
"to one of ten channels, and behave exactly like material textures, except "
"that they affect a lamp's color and intensity, rather than a material's "
"surface characteristics."

"The lamp textures settings are grouped into two panels. Here we will only "
"talk about the few things that differ from object material textures; see the"
" :doc:`Materials </materials>` and :doc:`Textures </textures>` chapters for "
"details about the standard options."

"The texture-specific and the :guilabel:`Mapping` panels remain the same. "
"However, you'll note there are much fewer :guilabel:`Mapping` options - you "
"can only choose between :guilabel:`Global`, :guilabel:`View` or another "
":guilabel:`Object` 's texture :guilabel:`coordinates` (since a lamp has no "
"texture coordinates by itself), and you can scale or offset the texture."

"The :guilabel:`Mapping` panel is also a subset of its regular material's "
"counterpart. You can only map a lamp texture to its regular, basic "
":guilabel:`Color` and/or to its :guilabel:`Shadow` color. As you can only "
"affect colors, and a lamp has no texture coordinates on its own, the "
":guilabel:`Diffuse`, :guilabel:`Specular`, :guilabel:`Shading`, and "
":guilabel:`Geometry` options have disappeared."
