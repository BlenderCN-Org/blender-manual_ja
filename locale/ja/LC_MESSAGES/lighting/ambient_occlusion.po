msgid ""
"Ambient Occlusion is a sophisticated ray-tracing calculation which simulates"
" soft global illumination shadows by faking darkness perceived in corners "
"and at mesh intersections, creases, and cracks, where ambient light is "
"occluded, or blocked."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/lighting/ambient_occlusion.rst:13
msgid ""
"There is no such thing as AO in real life; AO is a specific not-physically-"
"accurate (but generally nice-looking) rendering trick. It basically samples "
"a hemisphere around each point on the face, sees what proportion of that "
"hemisphere is occluded by other geometry, and shades the pixel accordingly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/lighting/ambient_occlusion.rst:19
msgid ""
"It's got nothing to do with light at all; it's purely a rendering trick that"
" tends to look nice because generally in real life surfaces that are close "
"together (like small cracks) will be darker than surfaces that don't have "
"anything in front of them, because of shadows, dirt, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/lighting/ambient_occlusion.rst:24
msgid ""
"The AO process, though, approximates this result; it's not simulating light "
"bouncing around or going through things. That's why AO still works when you "
"don't have any lights in the scene, and it's why just switching on AO alone "
"is a very bad way of \"lighting\" a scene."

"You must have an ambient light color set as you desire. By default, the "

"all colors. A good outdoor mid-day color is RGB (``0.9``, ``0.9``, ``0.8``) "
"which is a whitish yellow sunny kind of color on a bright-but-not-harshly-"
