":guilabel:`Inderect Lighting` adds inderect light bouncing of surrounding "
"objects. It's modes the light that is reflected from other surfaces to the "
"current surface. Is more comprehensive, more physically correct, and "
"produces more realistic images. It is also more computationally expensive. "
