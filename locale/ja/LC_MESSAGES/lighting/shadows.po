"Light wouldn't even exist without its counterpart: shadows. Shadows are a "
"darkening of a portion of an object because light is being partially or "
"totally blocked from illuminating the object. They add contrast and volume "
"to a scene; there is nearly no place in the real world without shadows, so "
"to get realistic renders, you will need them. Blender supports the following"
" kinds of shadows:"

"Ambient occlusion really isn't a shadow based on light *per se*, but based "
"on geometry. However, it does mimic an effect where light is prevented from "
"fully and uniformly illuminating an object, so it is mentioned here. Also, "
"it is important to mention ambient lighting, since increasing "
":guilabel:`Ambient` decreases the effect of a shadow."

"You can use a combination of ray-traced and buffer shadows to achieve "

"For example, the simple :guilabel:`Lamp`, :guilabel:`Area`, and "

":guilabel:`Hemi` light does not cast any. If a :guilabel:`Sun` lamp is "
"pointing sideways, it will not cast a shadow from a sphere above a plane "

"As opposed to FIXME(Link Type Unsupported: #lamps; [[#Lamps: Buffered "
