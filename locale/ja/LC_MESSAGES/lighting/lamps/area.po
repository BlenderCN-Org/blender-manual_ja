msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Area` lamp simulates light originating from a surface (or "
"surface-like) emitter. For example, a TV screen, your supermarket's neon "
"lamps, a window, or a cloudy sky are just a few types of area lamp. The area"
" lamp produces shadows with soft borders by sampling a lamp along a grid the"
" size of which is defined by the user. This is in direct contrast to point-"
"like artificial lights which produce sharp borders."

"Choosing the appropriate shape for your :guilabel:`Area` light will enhance "

"a :guilabel:`Rectangular` area lamp in a window (vertical) or from neons "
"(horizontal) with proper ratios for :guilabel:`Size X` and :guilabel:`Size "
"Y`. For the simulation of the light emitted by a TV screen a vertical "
":guilabel:`Square` area lamp would be better in most cases."
