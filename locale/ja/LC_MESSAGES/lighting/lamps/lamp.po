"The :guilabel:`Point` lamp is an omni-directional point of light, that is, a"
" point radiating the same amount of light in all directions. It's visualized"
" by a plain, circled dot. Being a point light source, the direction of the "
"light hitting an object's surface is determined by the line joining the lamp"
" and the point on the surface of the object itself."

"Light intensity/energy decays based on (among other variables) distance from"
" the :guilabel:`Point` lamp to the object. In other words, surfaces that are"
" further away are rendered darker."
