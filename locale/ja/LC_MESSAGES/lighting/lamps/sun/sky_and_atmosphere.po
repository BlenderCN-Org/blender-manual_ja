"This panel allows you to enable an effect that simulates various properties "
"of real sky and atmosphere: the scattering of sunlight as it crosses the "
"kilometers of air overhead. For example, when the Sun is high, the sky is "
"blue (and the horizon, somewhat whitish). When the Sun is near the horizon, "
"the sky is dark blue/purple, and the horizon turns orange. The dispersion of"
" the atmosphere is also more visible when it is a bit foggy: the farther "
"away an object is, the more \"faded\" in light gray it is... Go out into the"
