":guilabel:`Spot` lights also can produce \"volumetric\" effects. See "

"The :guilabel:`Halo` button allows a :guilabel:`Spot` lamp to have a "
"volumetric effect applied to it. This button must be active if the "
"volumetric effect is to be visible. Note that if you are using buffered "
"shadows, you have extra options described in the :doc:`Spot Buffered Shadows"
" </lighting/lamps/spot/buffered_shadows>` page."

"The :guilabel:`Intensity` slider controls how intense/dense the volumetric "
"effect is that is generated from the light source. The lower the value of "
"the :guilabel:`Intensity` slider, the less visible the volumetric effect is,"
" while higher :guilabel:`Intensity` values give a much more noticeable and "
"dense volumetric effect."

msgid ""
"This field can have a value between ``0`` and ``12``. It is used to "
"determine whether this :guilabel:`Spot` will cast volumetric shadows, and "
"what quality those volumetric shadows will have. If :guilabel:`Step` is set "
"to a value of ``0``, then no volumetric shadow will be generated. Unlike "
"most other controls, as the :guilabel:`Step` value increases, the quality of"
" volumetric shadows decreases (but take less time to render), and *vice "
"versa*."

"A value of ``8`` for :guilabel:`Halo Step` is usually a good compromise "

msgid ""
"Blender only simulates volumetric lighting in :guilabel:`Spot` lamps when "
"using its internal renderer. This can lead to some strange results for "
"certain combinations of settings for the light's :guilabel:`Energy` and the "
"halo's :guilabel:`Intensity`. For example, having a :guilabel:`Spot` light "
"with null or very low light :guilabel:`Energy` settings but a very high halo"
" :guilabel:`Intensity` setting can result in a dark/black halo, which would "
"not happen in the real world. Just be aware of this possibility when using "
"halos with the internal renderer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The halo effect can be greatly enhanced when using buffered shadows: when "
"the halo's :guilabel:`Step` is not null, they can create \"volumetric "
"shadows\". See the page about :guilabel:`Spot` :doc:`Buffered Shadows "
"</lighting/lamps/spot/buffered_shadows>` for more information."
