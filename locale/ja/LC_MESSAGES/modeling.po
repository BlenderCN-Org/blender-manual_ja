"Curves and :doc:`Surfaces </modeling/surfaces>` are particular types of "

"series of points. Blender offers both FIXME(TODO: Internal Link; "

" curves and surfaces. NURBS stands for \"Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines\". "

"The *Screw* tool combines a repetitive *Spin* with a translation, to "

"The main difference between the Screw Tool and the :doc:`Screw Modifier "

"angular progressions using the basic profile angle automatically or "
"adjusting the Axis angular vector without using a second modifier (for "
