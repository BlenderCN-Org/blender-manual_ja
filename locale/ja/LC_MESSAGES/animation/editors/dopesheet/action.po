"Blender 2.5 simplifies the system by making Actions the generic containers "
"for F-Curves. Actions can contain any number of F-Curves, and can be "
"attached to any data block.As long as the RNA data paths stored in the "
"Action's F-Curves can be found on that data block, the animation will work. "
"For example, an action modifying 'X location' and 'Y location' properties "
"can be shared across multiple objects, since both objects have 'X location' "
"and 'Y location' properties beneath them."

"However, there is one specificity with action datablocks: they have by "
"default a \"fake user\", i.e. once created, they are always kept in Blender "
"file, even if no object uses them. This is due to the fact that actions are "
"designed to be used in the NLA, where you can affect several different "
"actions to a same object! Yes, this is the only way to use different actions"
" (and hence, different FCurve datablocks of the same kind) to animate a same"
" object. But as you have to assign an action to an object to be able to edit"
" it (and an object can only have one action datablock at a time), to have "
"\"fake users\" guaranties you that you won't lost your precious previously-"
"edited actions when you start working on a new one!"
