"When something is \"animated,\" it changes over time. In Blender, animating "
"an object means changing one of its properties, such as its X location, or "
"the Red channel value of its material diffuse color, and so on, during a "
"certain amount of time."

"The idea is simple: you define a few Key Frames, which are multiple frames "
