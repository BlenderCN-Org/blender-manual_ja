"Markers are used to denote frames at which something significant happens - "
"it could be that a character's animation starts, the camera changes "
"position, or a door opens, for example. Markers can be given names to make "
"them more meaningful at a quick glance. They are available in many of "
"Blender's windows, under different forms. Unlike the keyframes, markers are "
"always placed at a whole frame number, you cannot e.g. set a marker at "
"\"frame ``2.5`` \"."
