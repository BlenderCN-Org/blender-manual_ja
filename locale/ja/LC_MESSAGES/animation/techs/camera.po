"As an example, we are going to create a nice and impressive camera effect, "
"which you can see e.g. in the first part of the Lord of the Ring: the "
"*transtrav*. Basically, the idea is to combine a forward zoom with a "
"backward traveling (or conversely), both controlled such as the point of "
"interest keeps its scale in the image, while its environment scales up or "
"down, depending whether it is nearer or more far from the camera..."

"Add a camera, place it as you like for the beginning of the transtrav (your "
"\"key\" object should be more or less at the center of the picture, it's "
"easier to handle!). As we are going to do a \"forward\" transtrav, you "
"should use a quite long lens at start. Go to frame ``10``, and insert a "
"keyframe for both the location (and optionally the rotation) of the camera "
"and its focal length."

"Now, go to frame ``140``, and move forward your camera to your key object. "
"Insert another keyframe for its position, and adjust its focal length until "
"your key object have the same visual dimensions as at the beginning. Add a "
"key to both attributes."

"This won't give you a fully perfect transtrav - to get such one, you would "
"have to dive into trigonometric maths... But the result is visually quite "
"satisfying."
