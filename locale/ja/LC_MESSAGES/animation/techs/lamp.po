"We won't detail the cave and torch creation - the first one is an deformed "
"icosphere with :guilabel:`Subsurf` and :doc:`Displace modifiers "
"</modifiers/deform/displace>`, and the second one, a cylinder scaled and "
"subdivided several times in its length, with a :doc:`particle system "
"</physics/particles>` to materialize its fire."

"The torch will be the only light source of the scene. Add four "
":guilabel:`Lamp` lamps, all using the same lamp datablock. Place them around"
" the tip of the torch, and parent them to it. Give them an orange color "
"(e.g. ``(1.0, 0.8, 0.4)``), a short :guilabel:`Distance` (``2.0``, but this "
"depends on the size of your cave!), and an :guilabel:`Inverse Square` "
"falloff. Also let them cast ray shadows (soft shadows, if you have enough "
"computing power)."

"Right click on the :guilabel:`Energy` parameter and :guilabel:`Insert "
"Keyframe` to create an Fcurve, then open the graph editor to edit the "
"keyframes. You can for example start at zero (no energy, the scene is whole "
"black), give a short and intense flash (``10`` over a few frames) to "
"simulate a sort of lightning lighting the fire, then back to very low "
"(``0.25``), and then a gently varying curve over the rest of the scene, to "
"simulate the irregularities of the flames."
