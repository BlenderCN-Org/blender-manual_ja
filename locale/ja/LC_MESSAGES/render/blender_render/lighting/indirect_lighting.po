"*Inderect Lighting* adds inderect light bouncing of surrounding objects. "
"It's modes the light that is reflected from other surfaces to the current "
"surface. Is more comprehensive, more physically correct, and produces more "
"realistic images. It is also more computationally expensive. Take a look at "
