"UV mapping is a very precise way of mapping a 2D texture to a 3D surface. "
"Each vertex of a mesh has its own UV co-ordinates which can be unwrapped and"
" laid flat like a skin. You can almost think of UV coordinates as a mapping "
"that works on a 2D plane with its own local coordinate system to the plane "
"on which it is operating on. This mapping is especially useful when using 2D"
" images as textures, as seen in :doc:`UV Mapping "
"</render/blender_render/textures/mapping/uv>`. You can use multiple textures"
" with one set of UV coordinates."
