msgid ""
"Objects on these layers are directly visible to the camera. When an object "
"is in the scene layers but not camera layers, it will still cast shadows or "
"be visible in reflections, so it's still indirectly visible. This is "
"equivalent to disabling the Camera in the Ray Visibility panel for the "
"object. The way this works may be somewhat confusing at first, but it's "
"designed such that render layers can be recomposed to give the full render, "
"without any missing shadows or reflections."
