"An important concept to understand when building node setups is that of the "

"Each shader node has a color input, and outputs a shader. These can then be "
"mixed and added together using Mix and Add Shader nodes. No other operations"
" are permitted. The resulting output can then be used by the render engine "
"to compute all light interactions, for direct lighting or global "
"illumination."
