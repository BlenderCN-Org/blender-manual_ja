"GPU rendering makes it possible to use your graphics card for rendering, "
"instead of the CPU. This can speed up rendering, because modern GPUs are "
"designed to do quite a lot of number crunching. On the other hand, they also"
" have some limitations in rendering complex scenes, due to more limited "
"memory, and issues with interactivity when using the same graphics card for "
"display and rendering."

"Cycles has two GPU rendering modes: through CUDA, which is the preferred "
"method for NVidia graphics cards; and OpenCL, which is intended to support "
"rendering on AMD/ATI graphics cards. The implementation of OpenCL is only in"

msgid "Why is Blender unresponsive during rendering?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:61
msgid ""
"While a graphics card is rendering, it can not redraw the user interface, "
"which makes Blender unresponsive. We attempt to avoid this problem by giving"
" back control over the :abbr:`GPU (Graphics processing unit)` as often as "
"possible, but a completely smooth interaction can't be guaranteed, "
"especially on heavy scenes. This is a limitation of graphics cards for which"
" no true solution exists, though we might be able to improve this somewhat "
"in the future."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:68

msgid "Why does a scene that renders on the CPU not render on the GPU?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:75
msgid ""
"There maybe be multiple causes, but the most common is that there is not "
"enough memory on your graphics card. We can currently only render scenes "
"that fit in graphics card memory, and this is usually smaller than that of "
"the CPU. Note that, for example, 8k, 4k, 2k and 1k image textures take up "
"respectively 256MB, 64MB, 16MB and 4MB of memory."

msgid ""
"Currently NVidia with CUDA is rendering faster. There is no fundamental "
"reason why this should be so—we don't use any CUDA-specific features—but the"
" compiler appears to be more mature, and can better support big kernels. "
"OpenCL support is still being worked on and has not been optimized as much, "
"because we haven't had the full kernel working yet."

"If a GPU is used for both display and rendering, Windows has a limit on the "
