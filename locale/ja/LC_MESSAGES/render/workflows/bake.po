"Baking, in general, is the act of pre-computing something in order to speed "
"up some other process later down the line. Rendering from scratch takes a "
"lot of time depending on the options you choose. Therefore, Blender allows "
"you to \"bake\" some parts of the render ahead of time, for select objects. "
"Then, when you press Render, the entire scene is rendered much faster, since"
" the colors of those objects do not have to be recomputed."

"Render baking creates 2D bitmap images of a mesh object's rendered surface. "
"These images can be re-mapped onto the object using the object's UV "
"coordinates. Baking is done for each individual mesh, and can only be done "
"if that mesh has been UV-unwrapped. While it takes time to set up and "
"perform, it saves render time. If you are rendering a long animation, the "
"time spent baking can be much less than time spent rendering out each frame "
"of a long animation."

"Use Render Bake in intensive light/shadow solutions, such as AO or soft "
"shadows from area lights. If you bake AO for the main objects, you will not "

"Use :guilabel:`Full Render` or :guilabel:`Textures` to create an image "
"texture; baked procedural textures can be used as a starting point for "
"further texture painting. Use :guilabel:`Normals` to make a low-resolution "
"mesh look like a high-resolution mesh. To do that, UV-unwrap a high-"
"resolution, finely sculpted mesh and bake its normals. Save that normal map,"
" and :guilabel:`Mapping` (texture settings) the UV of a similarly unwrapped "
"low-resolution mesh. The low-resolution mesh will look just like the high-"
"resolution, but will have much fewer faces/polygons."

"When using this in conjunction with a subsurf and displacement modifier "

"to the 'low res' model before baking. This means that if you then use a "
"displacement modifier on top of the subsurf, the displacement will be "
"correct, since it's stored as a relative difference to the subsurfed "
"geometry, rather than the original base mesh (which can get distorted "
"significantly by a subsurf). The higher the render level subsurf while "
"baking, the more accurate the displacements will be. This technique may also"
" be useful when saving the displacement map out for use in external "
