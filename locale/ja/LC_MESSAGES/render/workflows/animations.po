"While rendering stills will allow you to view and save the image from the "
"render buffer when it's complete, animations are a series of images, or "
"frames, and are automatically saved directly out to disk after being "
"rendered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After rendering the frames, you may need to edit the clips, or first use the"
" Compositor to do green-screen masking, matting, color correction, DOF, and "
"so on to the images. That result is then fed to the Sequencer where the "
"strips are cut and mixed and a final overlay is done."

"Generally, you do a lot of intermediate renders of different frames in your "
"animation to check for timing, lighting, placement, materials, and so on. At"
" some point, you are ready to make a final render of the complete animation "
"for publication."

"There are two approaches you can use when making a movie, or animation, with"
" or without sound. The approach you should use depends on the amount of CPU "
"time you will need to render the movie (see :doc:`Render Performance "
"</render/performance/index>`). You can render a \"typical\" frame at the "
"desired resolution, and then multiply by the number of frames that will "
"ultimately go into the movie, to arrive at an total render time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:31
msgid ""
"If the total render time is an hour or more, you want to use the \"Frame "
"Sequence\" approach. For example, if you are rendering a one-minute video "
"clip for film, there will be (60 seconds per minute) * (24 frames per "
"second) or 1440 frames per minute. If each frame takes 30 seconds to render,"
" then you will be able to render two frames per minute, or need 720 minutes "
"(12 hours) of render time."

"Rendering takes all available CPU time; you should render overnight, when "
"the computer is not needed, or set Blender to a low priority while "

"The **Direct Approach** —highly **not** recommended and not a standard "
"practice—is where you set your output format to an AVI or MOV format, and "
"click ANIM to render your scene directly out to a movie file. Blender "
"creates one file that holds all the frames of your animation. You can then "
"use Blender's VSE to add an audio track to the animation and render out to "
"an MPEG format to complete your movie."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:49
msgid ""
"The **Frame Sequence** is a much more stable approach, where you set your "
"output format to a still format (such as JPG, PNG or MultiLayer), and click "
"ANIM to render your scene out to a set of images, where each image is the "
"frame in the sequence."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/workflows/animations.rst:54
msgid ""
"Blender creates a file for each frame of the animation. You can then use "
"Blender's compositor to perform any frame manipulation (post processing). "
"You can then use Blender's VSE to load that final image sequence, add an "
"audio track to the animation, and render out to an MPEG format to complete "
"your movie. The Frame Sequence approach is a little more complicated and "
"takes more disk space, but gives you more flexibility."
