#~ "Render layers are used to separate your composite image into layers. Use "

#~ "relighting isolated elements within the image via a normal pass, adding a "
#~ "colorcast to specific portions of the image, etc. The keyword here is "
#~ "isolation. Render layers allow you to dissect, effect and/or correct "
#~ "individual elements or groups within your composition before outputting your"
#~ " final render. This saves you from endlessly re-rendering your scene just to"
#~ " find out whether a correction is going to work or not."
