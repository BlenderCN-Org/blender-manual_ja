"Render layers are used to separate your composite image into layers. Use "
"Render Layers for a specific reason - such as creating depth of field, "
"relighting isolated elements within the image via a normal pass, adding a "
"colorcast to specific portions of the image, etc. The keyword here is "
"isolation. Render layers allow you to dissect, effect and/or correct "
"individual elements or groups within your composition before outputting your"
" final render. This saves you from endlessly re-rendering your scene just to"
" find out whether a correction is going to work or not."
