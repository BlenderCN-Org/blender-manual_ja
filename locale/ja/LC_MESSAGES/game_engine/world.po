"World settings enable you to set some basic effects which affect all scenes "
"throughout your game, so giving it a feeling of unity and continuity.  These"
" include ambient light, depth effects (mist) and global physics settings. "
"These effects are a limited subset of the more extensive range of effects "
"available with the Blender internal or cycles renderer."

msgid ""
"While world settings offer a simple way of adding effects to a scene, "
":doc:`compositing nodes </composite_nodes>` are often preferred, though more"
" complex to master, for the additional control and options they offer. For "
"example, filtering the Z value (distance from camera) or normals (direction "
"of surfaces) through compositing nodes can further increase the depth and "
"spacial clarity of a scene."

" less it's alpha value will be. For full details, see :doc:`Mist "
