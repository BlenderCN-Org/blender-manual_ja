"The Vehicle Controller is a special :ref:`type of physics object "
"<game_engine-physics-types>` that the Physics Engine (bullet) recognizes."

msgid ""
"It is composed of a **rigid body** representing the chassis and a set of "
"wheels that are set to **no collision**. Emphasizing the distinction between"
" a GameEngine, Logical or Render object and its representation for the "
"Physics Engine is important."

"To simulate a vehicle as a true rigid body, on top of also rigid body "
"wheels, with a real suspension system made with joints, would be far too "
"complicated and unstable. Cars and other vehicles are complicated mechanical"
" devices and most often we do not want to simulate that, only that it 'acts "
"as expected'. The Vehicle Controller exists to provide a dedicated way of "
"simulating a vehicle behavior without having to simulate all the physics "
"that would actually happen in the real world. It abstracts the complexity "
"away by providing a simple interface with tweakable parameters such as "
"suspension force, damping and compression."

"Bullet's approach to a vehicle controller is called a \"Raycast Vehicle\". "
"Collision detection for the wheels is approximated by ray casts and the tire"
" friction is an  anisotropic friction model."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/object/vehicle.rst:22
msgid ""
"A raycast vehicle works by casting a ray for each wheel.  Using the ray's "
"intersection point, we can calculate the suspension length and hence the "
"suspension force that is then applied to the chassis, keeping it from "
"hitting the ground.  In effect, the vehicle chassis 'floats' along on the "
"rays."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/object/vehicle.rst:24
msgid ""
"The friction force is calculated for each wheel where the ray contacts the "
"ground.  This is applied as a sideways and forwards force."

"You should have a body acting as the chassis, set it as a 'Rigid Body'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The wheels should be separate objects set to 'No Collision'. The vehicle "
"controller will calculate the collisions for you as rays so, if you set it "
"to something else, it will calculate it twice in different ways and produce "
"weird results."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/game_engine/physics/object/vehicle.rst:45
msgid ""
"A cylinder is typically a good collision shape for the wheels. For the "
"chassis, the shape should be rough, like a box. If the vehicle is very "
"complicated, you should split it into simpler objects and parent those (with"
" their collision shapes) to the vehicle controller so that they will follow "
"it. If your vehicle even has moving bits (weapons, wrecking balls, trolleys "
"etc) they should also be simulated separately and connected to the vehicle "
"as a joint."
