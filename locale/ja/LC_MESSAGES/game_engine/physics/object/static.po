"Static objects in the :doc:`Blender Game Engine </game_engine>` do not "
"automatically react to physics, including gravity and collisions. Even if "
"hit by the force of a speeding 18-wheeler truck, it will remain unresponsive"
" in terms of location, rotation, or deformation."

"It will, however, give collision reactions. Objects will bounce off of "
"Static Objects, and rotational inertia will transfer to objects capable of "
"rotating (that is, Rigid Body Objects will spin in response, though Dynamic "
"Objects will not)."

"Note that none of this prevents you from transforming the Static Objects "
"with :doc:`Logic Bricks </game_engine/logic>` or Python code. The visual "
"objects will correctly move and their physics representation will update in "
"the engine as well."

"Another important note is that the default FIXME(TODO: Internal Link; "
"[[#Collision_Bounds|Collision Bounds]] ) is a Triangle Mesh, meaning it is "
"higher in computational requirements but also in detail. This in turn means "
"the \"Radius\" option has no effect by default."
