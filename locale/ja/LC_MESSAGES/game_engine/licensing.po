"The licensing of games created for distribution using the Blender Game "
"Engine and the Standalone Player is complicated by Blender's status as open-"

"Unfortunately, this does not extend to games or other artwork distributed to"
" run under the Blender Standalone Player. To distribute your game you need "
"to create an executable (run time). What it does is take your Blender .blend"
" file and put it \"inside\" the Standalone Player - a stripped-down version "
"of Blender containing only the functions corresponding to the Blender Game "
"Engine. The resulting executable file falls into the category of "
"\"derivatives\" of the original program (i.e. a hybrid of your file with the"
" Standalone Player itself), and therefore must be licensed as GPL."

"Use the Game Actuator, which enables a basic .blend game file to start. By "
"making a basic file which contains an \"Always\" sensor to run, and allowing"
" this to activate a \"Game\" actuator to load and run the full content of "
"your game, this gets round the problem. Your main file is now \"outside\" "
"the Standalone Player, so that it need not be open to GPL and is therefore "
"\"legally protected\". Although your game is not fully protected with this "
"system, it affords a similar level of protection to that used in most other "
"distributed games. The fact that others can access your .blend file does not"
" mean that it can be used for purposes not covered by the license you want."
