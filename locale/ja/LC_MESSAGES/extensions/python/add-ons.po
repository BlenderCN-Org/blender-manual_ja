":guilabel:`Add-On` is the general term for any optional script that extends "
"Blender's functionality. They are found in the :guilabel:`Add-Ons` tab of "
"the :guilabel:`User Preferences` window. This tab allows to install, enable "
"and disable Add-Ons. Blender comes with some useful Add-Ons already, but you"
" can also add your own, or any interesting ones you find on the web. The "
"`Scripts Catalog "
"<http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts>`__ provides an"
" index of Add-Ons that are included with Blender as well as listing a number"
" of external Add-Ons."
