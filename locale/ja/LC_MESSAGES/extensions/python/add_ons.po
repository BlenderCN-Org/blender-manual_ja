"*Add-On* is the general term for any optional script that extends Blender's "
"functionality. They are found in the *Add-Ons* tab of the *User Preferences*"
" window. This tab allows to install, enable and disable Add-Ons. Blender "
"comes with some useful Add-Ons already, but you can also add your own, or "
"any interesting ones you find on the web. The `Scripts Catalog "
"<http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts>`__ provides an"
" index of Add-Ons that are included with Blender as well as listing a number"
" of external Add-Ons."
