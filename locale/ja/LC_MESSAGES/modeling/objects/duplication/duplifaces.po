"In this example we will use a UV sphere with an extruded \"north pole\" as "
"our base object and cube as our parent mesh.  To parent the sphere to the "

":kbd:`Shift-RMB` select the cube (order is very important here), and finally"
" :kbd:`Ctrl-P` to parent."

"duplicated for each face on the cube."

"The positioning of the duplicated geometry relative to the face is dependent"
" upon the position of the child objects relative to the duplicator's origin."
"  This can lead to some visual artifacts in the editor as the geometry of "
"the original objects overlaps or intersects with the duplicates. One "
"workaround is to move the origin of the duplicator mesh off of the plane of "
"the faces."
msgstr ""

"If the geometry of the children is not symmetrical then the orientation of "
"the face (as determined by the order of its vertices) could matter.  As of "
"2.70 blender does not have tools which allow you to adjust the ordering of "
"the vertices on a face."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/objects/duplication/duplifaces.rst:85
msgid ""
"However, there is a workflow that lets you control for this.  Make a single "
"square and enable the Duplication / Faces so you can see the duplicated "
"geometry in your editor window. If the orientation is not what you want, "
"rotate the face until it is how you want. Typically you want to do the "
"rotation in Edit mode, not Object mode, but this is not a hard rule."

"Once you have the orientation correct, Duplicate the face and move the "
"duplicate where you want it. Repeat this process until you have enough "
"faces. Since it is common for these faces to butt up against one another, "
"your geometry will have lots of duplicate vertices. Use the Remove Doubles "
"button in the Tools panel."
