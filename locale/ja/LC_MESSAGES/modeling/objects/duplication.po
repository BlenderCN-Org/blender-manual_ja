"This copy is a new object, which \"\\ **shares** \" some datablocks with the"
" original object (by default, all the Materials, Textures, and Ipos), but "
"which has copied others, like the mesh, for example. This is why this form "
"of duplication is sometimes called \"shallow link\", because not all "
