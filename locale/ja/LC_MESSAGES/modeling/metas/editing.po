"This discussion of \"polygonization\" *doesn't* mean that the various meshes"
" don't deform towards or away from each other (meta objects always influence"
" one another in the usual way, whether or not they are members of the same "
"family). Rather, it means that the underlying mesh structure changes only "
"when the *base* object transforms. For example, if you scale the *base*, the"
" children's mesh structure changes. In (*Scaling the \"base\"*), the *base* "
"has been scaled down, which has the effect of scaling the mesh structure of "
"each of the children. As you can see, the children's mesh resolution has "
