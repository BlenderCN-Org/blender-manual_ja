"The mirror tool in :guilabel:`Edit` mode is similar to  :doc:`Mirroring in "
"Object mode </3d_interaction/transformations/advanced/mirror>`. It is "
"exactly equivalent to scaling by -1 vertices, edges or faces around one "
"chosen pivot point and in the direction of one chosen axis, only it is "
"faster/handier."
