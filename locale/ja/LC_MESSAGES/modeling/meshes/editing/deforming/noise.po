":guilabel:`Noise` is an old feature. The :doc:`Displace Modifier "
"</modifiers/deform/displace>` is a non-destructive alternative to the Noise "
"tool and is a more flexible way to realize these sort of effects. The key "
"advantages of the modifier are that it can be canceled at any moment, you "
"can precisely control how much and in which direction the displacement is "
"applied, and much more.... See also the ANT Landscape :doc:`add-on "
"</extensions/python/add-ons>`."

"The :guilabel:`Noise` function allows you to displace vertices in a mesh "
"based on the grey values of the first texture slot of the material applied "

"The mesh must have a material and a texture assigned to it for this tool to "
"work. To avoid having the texture affect the material's properties, it can "

":guilabel:`Noise` permanently modifies your mesh according to the material "
"texture. Each click adds onto the current mesh. For a temporary effect, map "
"the texture to Displacement for a render-time effect. In :guilabel:`Object` "
"/ :guilabel:`Edit` mode, your object will appear normal, but will render "
"deformed."
