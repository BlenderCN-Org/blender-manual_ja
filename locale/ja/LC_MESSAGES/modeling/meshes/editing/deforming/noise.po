"*Noise* is an old feature. The :doc:`Displace Modifier "
"</modifiers/deform/displace>` is a non-destructive alternative to the Noise "
"tool and is a more flexible way to realize these sort of effects. The key "
"advantages of the modifier are that it can be canceled at any moment, you "
"can precisely control how much and in which direction the displacement is "
"applied, and much more.... See also the ANT Landscape :doc:`add-on "
"</extensions/python/add_ons>`."
