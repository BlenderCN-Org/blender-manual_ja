"The bevel tool allows you to create chamfered or rounded corners to "
"geometry. A bevel is an effect that smooths out edges and corners. True "
"world edges are very seldom exactly sharp. Not even a knife blade edge can "
"be considered perfectly sharp. Most edges are intentionally beveled for "
"mechanical and practical reasons."

"Bevels are also useful for giving realism to non-organic models. In the real"
" world, the blunt edges on objects catch the light and change the shading "
"around the edges. This gives a solid, realistic look, as opposed to un-"
"beveled objects which can look too perfect."
