"The bevel tool allows you to create chamfered or rounded corners to "
"geometry. A bevel is an effect that smooths out edges and corners. True "
"world edges are very seldom exactly sharp. Not even a knife blade edge can "
"be considered perfectly sharp. Most edges are intentionally beveled for "
"mechanical and practical reasons."

"Bevels are also useful for giving realism to non-organic models. In the real"
" world, the blunt edges on objects catch the light and change the shading "
"around the edges. This gives a solid, realistic look, as opposed to un-"
"beveled objects which can look too perfect."

"The :doc:`Bevel Modifier </modifiers/generate/bevel>` is a non destructive "
"alternative to the bevel tool. It gives you the same options, with "
"additional goodies, like the bevel width controlled by the vertices weight, "
"and all the modifiers general enhancements (non-destructive operations, "
"...). Note that the :guilabel:`Bevel` modifier has no recursive option. To "
"overcome this, you can add additional modifiers to multiply the effect."

msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Bevel` tool works only on selected edges. It will recognize "
"any edges included in a vertex or face selection as well, and perform the "
"bevel the same as if those edges were explicitly selected. The "
":guilabel:`Bevel` tool smooths the edges and/or \"corners\" (vertices) by "
"\"subdividing\" them a specified number of times (see the options below for "
"details about the bevel algorithm)."

"Use :kbd:`Ctrl-B` or a method listed above to run the tool. Move the mouse "

"You can change the bevel width by moving the mouse towards and away from the"
" object, a bit like with transform tools. As usual, the scaling can be "
"controlled to a finer degree by  holding :kbd:`shift` to scale in 0.001 "
"steps. :kbd:`lmb` finalizes the operation, :kbd:`rmb` or :kbd:`Esc` aborts "
"the action."
