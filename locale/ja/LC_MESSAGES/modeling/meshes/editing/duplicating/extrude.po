"The selection is extruded along the common normal of selected faces. In "
"every other case the extrusion can be limited to a single axis by specifying"
" an axis (e.g. :kbd:`X` to limit to the X axis or :kbd:`Shift-X` to the YZ "
"plane. When extruding along the face normal, limiting movement to the global"
" Z axis requires pressing :kbd:`Z` twice, once to disable the face normal Z "
