"Edge loops can be selected by first selecting an edge (vertex or edge "
"selection mode), and then going to :menuselection:`Select --> Edge Loop`. "
"The shortcut :kbd:`alt-rmb` on an edge (either vertex or edge select mode) "
"is a quicker and more powerful way of doing so. More powerful, because you "
"can add/remove loops from an existing selection if you press :kbd:`Shift` "
"too."

"Note, that if you want to select a loop while being in vertex select mode, "
"you still have to perform the shortcut on an edge - while you, for just "
"selecting vertices, would rightclick on a vertex."

"RMB` twice, it is easier to first switch to Vertex Select Mode, which will "
