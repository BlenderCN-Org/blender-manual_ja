"In basic meshes, everything is built from three basic structures: "
"*Vertices*, *Edges* and *Faces* (we're not talking about curves, NURBS, and "
"so forth here). But there is no need to be disappointed: this simplicity "
"still provides us with a wealth of possibilities that will be the foundation"
" for all our models."

"An edge always connects two vertices by a straight line. The edges are the "
"\"wires\" you see when you look at a mesh in wireframe view. They are "
"usually invisible on the rendered image. They are used to construct faces. "

"Take care when using four-sided faces (quads), because internally they are "
"simply divided into two triangles each. Four-sided faces only work well if "
"the face is pretty much flat (all points lie within one imaginary plane) and"
" convex (the angle at no corner is greater than or equal to 180 degrees). "
"This is the case with the faces of a cube, for example. That's why you can't"
" see any diagonal in its wireframe model, because they would divide each "
"square face into two triangles."

"Note that loops ``2`` and ``4`` do not go around the whole model. Loops stop"
" at so called poles because there is no unique way to continue a loop from a"
" pole. Poles are vertices that are connected to either three, five, or more "
"edges. Accordingly, vertices connected to exactly one, two or four edges are"

"and end vertex in case of poles)."

"Edge Loops are an important concept especially in organic (subsurface) "
"modeling and character animation. When used correctly, they allow you to "
"build models with relatively few vertices that look very natural when used "
"as subdivision surfaces and deform very well in animation."

"Take (*Edge Loops in organic modeling*) as an example: the edge loops follow"
" the natural contours and deformation lines of the skin and the underlying "
"muscles and are more dense in areas that deform more when the character "

"containing the poles are not included in a Face Loop."

"While you could build a cube with triangular faces, it would just look more "
"confusing in *Edit mode*. An area between three or four vertices, outlined "
"by edges, doesn't have to be a face. If this area does not contain a face, "
"it will simply be transparent or non-existent in the rendered image. To "
"create a face, select three or four suitable vertices and press :kbd:`F`."

"A simple way to create a new vertex is to click :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` in *Edit "
"mode*. Of course, as a computer screen is two-dimensional, Blender can't "
"determine all three vertex coordinates from a single mouse click, so the new"
" vertex is placed at the depth of the 3D cursor. Using the method described "
"above, any vertices selected previously are automatically connected to the "
"new ones by an edge. In the image above, the vertex labeled *C* is a new "

"A face is the highest level structure in a mesh. Faces are used to build the"
" actual surface of the object. They are what you see when you render the "
"mesh. A face is defined as the area between either three (triangles) or four"
" (quadrangles) vertices, with an edge on every side. Triangles are always "
"flat and therefore easy to calculate. On the other hand, quadrangles "
"\"deform well\" and are therefore preferred for subdivision modeling."
