":guilabel:`Curve Deform` provides a simple but efficient method of defining "
"a deformation on a mesh. By parenting a mesh object to a curve, you can "
"deform the mesh up or down the curve by moving the mesh along, or orthogonal"
" to, the dominant axis. This is a most useful tool to make an object follow "
"a complex path, like e.g. a sheet of paper inside a printer, a film inside a"
" camera, the water of a canal..."

msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Curve Deform` works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. "
"This means that when you move your mesh in the dominant direction, the mesh "
"will traverse along the curve. Moving the mesh in an orthogonal direction "
"will move the mesh object closer or further away from the curve. The default"
" settings in Blender map the Y axis to the dominant axis. When you move the "
"object beyond the curve endings the object will continue to deform based on "
"the direction vector of the curve endings."
