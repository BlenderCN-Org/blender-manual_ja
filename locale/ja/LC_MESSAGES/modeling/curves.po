"Curves and :doc:`Surfaces </modeling/surfaces>` are particular types of "
"Blender Objects. They are expressed by mathematical functions rather than a "
"series of points. Blender offers both FIXME(TODO: Internal Link; "

" ) curves and surfaces. NURBS stands for \"Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines\"."
" Both Bezier curves and NURBS curves and surfaces are defined in terms of a "

"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that "
