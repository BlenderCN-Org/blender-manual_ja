"Scene management and library appending/linking is based on Blender's "
":doc:`Library and Data System </data_system>`, so it is a good idea to read "
"that manual page first if you're not familiar with the basics of that "
"system."

"Blender can be used to create something as simple as a single scene or "
"image, or scaled up to an entire movie. A movie is usually comprised of "

"Each act contains a few scenes, settings where the action happens. Each "
"scene is shot on a set, stage or location. Each is set with props and "
"backdrops. The scene is a set of action sequences where the actors act "
"(hopefully convincingly). Each sequence, or shot, usually lasts a few "
"seconds."

"Sometimes, a single shot lasts several minutes: its a \"sequence shot\", "
"which might even be a complete scene on its own. Technique hard to master if"

"A single Blender file is organized and set up to be able to contain an "
"entire movie. Each . blend file can contain multiple scenes. A scene is a "
"bunch of objects, organized into layers. As you progress through the "
"creative process, you use a set of window :doc:`screen layouts "
"</data_system/scene_creation>` specifically designed to help you work "
"efficiently through the creative process: model the objects and create the "
"props, clothe the actors and dress the set (assign materials), define the "
"action (animation), render the video, and produce the movie. You can tailor "
"these screen layouts, and create custom layouts, to match your working "
"preferences."

"Shots within a scene are accomplished by moving a camera and/or actors "
"through the scene for a few seconds. Time in Blender is measured in frames "
"by default (even though you can change to seconds too if you wish), and "
"typical video has 25 or 30 frames per second (fps), and film is 24 fps. For "
"a five-second shot then, you allocate up to 150 frames for that shot (30 fps"
" × 5 seconds). Giving yourself some wiggle-room, shot 2 would start at frame"
" 250 and go from there. A one-minute movie set in a single scene for North "
"America video broadcast (NTSC standard) would have a timeline that goes up "
"to 1800 final frames, and may be laid out over the course of 2500 frames. "
"This timeline allows for cutting out 700 frames, picking the best 1800 "
"frames (30 fps × 60 seconds = 1800 frames) less transition time."
