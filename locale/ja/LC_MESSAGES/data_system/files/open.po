"Blender is aimed at production level use and relies heavily on Python, a "

"Part of Python's power comes from having full access to your system, however"

"To protect against malicious .blend files, it's possible to prevent any "

"that custom tools or rigs using Python features will not work, but this "
"won't be a problem for .blend files that don't use these (such as material "
"libraries), and will at least give you a chance to better evaluate what "
"risks might be inside."

"By default, Blender will trust all files and run scripts automatically. If "
"you don't trust the file, and want protection, you can disable 'Trusted "
"source' in the Fileâ†’Open dialog in the properties section on the bottom "
"left. Un-trusted files will disable embedded Python scripts after opening "
"the file."
