"Scenes are a way to organize your work. Scenes can share objects, but can, "
"for example, differ from one another in their rendered resolution or their "
"camera view. The current window layout and scene are shown in the "
":guilabel:`Info` window header, usually displayed at the top of your screen:"

msgid ""
"Inside each .blend file, Blender saves the user interface layout - the "
"arrangement of screen layouts when the file is saved. By default, this saved"
" UI is loaded, over-riding any user defaults or the current screen layout. "
"However, you can work on a blend file using your current UI settings by "
"ignoring the UI settings saved in the file. This is done by restarting "
"Blender or resetting it with (:guilabel:`File` → :guilabel:`New`, or "
":kbd:`ctrl-X`), and opening the file browser with (:guilabel:`File` → "
":guilabel:`Open...`, or :kbd:`F1`). Turn off the :guilabel:`Load UI` button "
"in the file browser header, and then open the file. This way, Blender will "
"not disturb your current screen layout when it loads the new file."
