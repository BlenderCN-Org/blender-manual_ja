"Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To create "
"mist, Blender makes objects farther away more transparent (decreasing their "
"Alpha value) so that they mix more of the background color with the object "
"color. With Mist enabled, the further the object is away from the camera the"
" less it's alpha value will be."
