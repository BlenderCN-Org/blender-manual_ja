"Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To create "
"mist, Blender makes objects farther away more transparent (decreasing their "
"Alpha value) so that they mix more of the background color with the object "
"color. With Mist enabled, the further the object is away from the camera the"
" less it's alpha value will be."

"Because :guilabel:`Mist` works by adjusting transparency, this can sometimes"
" cause objects to be partially transparent when they shouldn't be. One "
"workaround is to set the Mist settings as desired, but turn Mist off. The "
"Mist data is still available for compositing even though it is off.  Use "
":doc:`Do Composite </composite_nodes>` and the :doc:`Nodes Editor "
"</composite_nodes/editor>` to feed the Mist pass to an :doc:`AlphaOver "
"</composite_nodes/types/color#alphaover_node>` to blend the background color"
" (or a render layer with just the sky) with the rendered image. This "
"produces the mist effect but since Mist is off the object transparency (or "
"lack of) is preserved."
