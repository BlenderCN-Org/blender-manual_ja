"The world buttons let you set up the shading of your scene in general. It "
"can provide ambient color, and special effects such as mist, but a very "
"common use of a :guilabel:`World` is to shade a background color."

"**Real Sky** If this option is added, the gradient produced has two "

"blending is also dependent on the camera orientation, which makes it more "
