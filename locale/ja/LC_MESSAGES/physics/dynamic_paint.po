"Dynamic paint is a new modifier and physics system that can turn objects "
"into paint canvases and brushes, creating vertex colors, image sequences or "
"displacement. This makes many effects possible that were previously "
"difficult to achieve, for example footsteps in the snow, raindrops that make"
" the ground wet, paint that sticks to walls, or objects that gradually "
"freeze."
