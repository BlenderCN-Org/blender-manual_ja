"All regions of this object that are inside the domain bounding box will be "
"used as actual fluid in the simulation. If you place more than one fluid "
"object inside the domain, they should currently not intersect. Also make "
"sure the surface normals are pointing outwards. In contrast to domain "
"objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for fluid objects."

"Blender uses the orientation of the Surface Normals to determine what is "
"\"inside of\" the Fluid object and what is \"outside\". You want all of the "
"normals to face *outside* (in :guilabel:`Edit mode`, use :kbd:`ctrl-N` or "
"press :kbd:`Space` and choose :guilabel:`Edit`?? :guilabel:`Normals`?? "
":guilabel:`Calculate Outside`). If the normals face the wrong way, you'll be"
" rewarded with a \"gigantic flood of water\" because Blender will think that"
" the volume of the object is outside of its mesh! This applies regardless of"
" the :guilabel:`Volume init` type setting."
