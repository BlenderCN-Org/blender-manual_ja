"Fluid animation can take a lot of time - the better you understand how it "
"works, the easier it will be to estimate how the results will look. The "
"algorithm used for Blender's fluid simulation is the *Lattice Boltzmann "
"Method* (LBM); other fluid algorithms include *Navier-Stokes* (NS) solvers "
"and *Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics* (SPH) methods. LBM lies somewhere "
"between these two."

"The viscosity of water is already really low, so especially for small "
"resolutions, the turbulence of water can not be correctly captured. If you "
"look closely, most simulations of fluids in computer graphics do not yet "
"look like real water as of now. Generally, don't rely on the physical "
"settings too much (such as physical domain size or length of the animation "
"in seconds). Rather try to get the overall motion right with a low "
"resolution, and then increase the resolution as much as possible or desired."

#~ "In general, it is really hard for current computers to correctly simulate "
#~ "even a 1-meter tank of water. For simulating a wave crashing through a city,"
#~ " you would probably need one of the most expensive supercomputers you could "
#~ "get, and it might still not work properly, no matter which of the three "
#~ "algorithms above you're using. Therefore, to achieve \"the effect that you "
#~ "really want\", you'll need to resort to strategies very similar to what "
#~ "filmmakers have been doing (quite successfully...) in \"analogue\" movies "
#~ "for many years: \"\\ *fake it!* \""

#~ "A good fluid simulation is a *very important* part, but not the *only* part,"
#~ " of achieving a satisfactory image. Let Blender do the computational dirty-"
#~ "work of calculating the basic fluid simulation, then create realism by "

#~ "For example, you can pretend to have a wave in a gigantic city by: building "
#~ "a *smaller* model, modeling a *small* wave in the model at very high "
#~ "resolution, and hope that nobody will notice the difference between a 100m "
#~ "and a 1m wave (they won't). Texture the wave front with lots of noise and "
#~ "clouds affecting the color. Add lots of smoke (mist) emitters on the various"
#~ " surfaces that the wave hits, timing each of them to emit at the moment of "
#~ "impact in a direction incident to the surface and collision. Animate cars "
#~ "and trash (and drowning people...) to float and bob on the wave front using "
#~ "the baked mesh. Use a string of mist emitters pointing up positioned at the "
#~ "wave crest to simulate the mist that blows off the top of the crest into the"
#~ " air. Consider exactly where you want to put the camera, whether you want to"
#~ " use a zoom lens or a wide angle, and so on (is the viewer to be \"looking "
#~ "down upon the poor unfortunate actors\", or \"drowning along with them\"?). "
#~ "*This* is the kind of attention to detail, above and beyond the fluid "
#~ "simulation itself, that will carry the shot."
