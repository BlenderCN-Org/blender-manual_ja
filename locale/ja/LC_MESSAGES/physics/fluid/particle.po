"This type can be used to display particles created during the simulation. "
"For now only tracers swimming along with the fluid are supported. Note that "
"the object can have any shape, position or type - once the particle button "
"is pressed, a particle system with the fluid simulation particles will be "
"created for it at the correct position. When moving the original object, it "
"might be necessary to delete the particle system, disable the fluidsim "
"particles, and enable them again. The fluidsim particles are currently also "
"unaffected by any other particle forces or settings."
