"The complete path of the particles is calculated in advance. So everything a"

"every frame of the particle animation point by point there are calculated "
"control points with an interpolation, the segments."

"A more advanced way of changing the hair appearance is to use :doc:`Children"

"Set the amount of hair strands. Use as little particles as possible, "
