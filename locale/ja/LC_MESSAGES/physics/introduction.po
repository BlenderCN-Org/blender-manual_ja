"Gravity is a global setting that is applied the same to all physics systems "
"in a scene, which can be found in the scene tab. This value is generally "
"fine left at its default value, at -9.810 in the Z axis, which is the force "
"of gravity in the real world. Lowering this value would simulate a lower or "
"higher force of gravity. Gravity denoted g, measurement [m×s\\ :sup:`-2` ])."

"Gravity is practically same around whole **Earth**. South and North poles "
"have g = 9.832 m×s\\ :sup:`-2`, on the equator g = 9. 780 m×s\\ :sup:`-2`. "
"For detail computing of falling in :guilabel:`Prague` or :guilabel:`Boston` "
"use 9.81373. For rendering scenes from **Moon** use value 6 times smaller, "
