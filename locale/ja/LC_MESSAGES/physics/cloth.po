"Cloth simulation is one of the hardest aspects of CG, because it is a "
"deceptively simple real-world item that is taken for granted, yet actually "
"has very complex internal and environmental interactions. After years of "
"development, Blender has a very robust cloth simulator that is used to make "
"clothing, flags, banners, and so on. Cloth interacts with and is affected by"
" other moving objects, the wind and other forces, as well as a general "
"aerodynamic model, all of which is under your control."

"A piece of cloth is any mesh, open or enclosed, that has been designated as "
"cloth. The :guilabel:`Cloth` panels are located in the :guilabel:`Physics` "
"sub-context and consist of three panels of options. Cloth is either an open "
"or closed mesh and is mass-less, in that all cloth is assumed to have the "
"same density, or mass per square unit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cloth is commonly modeled as a mesh grid primitive, or a cube, but can also "
"be, for example, a teddy bear. However, Blender's :doc:`Softbody system "

"a specialized simulation of fabrics."

"Once the object is designated as Cloth, a Cloth :doc:`modifier </modifiers>`"
" will be added to the object's modifier stack automatically. As a "
":doc:`modifier </modifiers>` then, it can interact with other modifiers, "
"such as :guilabel:`Armature` and :guilabel:`Smooth`. In these cases, the "
"ultimate shape of the mesh is computed in accordance with the order of the "
"modifier stack. For example, you should smooth the cloth *after* the "
"modifier computes the shape of the cloth."
