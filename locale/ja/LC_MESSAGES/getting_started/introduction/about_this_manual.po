"This manual is written by a world-wide collaboration of volunteers. It is "
"constantly out of date, thanks to the tireless work of developers working "
"from around the world on the Blender code-base. However, it is our goal to "
"provide you with the best possible documentation on this incredible package."

"To assist you best, this manual is organized according to the creative "
"process generally followed by 3D artists. If you read the manual linearly, "
"you will follow the path most artists use in both learning Blender and "
"developing their artistic skills."

"Getting to know Blender and learning Computer Graphics (CG) as an art are "
"two different topics. Learning what an object is, and then learning how to "
"model one in Blender are two different things to learn. Learning good "
"lighting techniques, and then learning about the different kinds of lamps in"
" Blender are two different topics."

"The first, or conceptual understanding, is learned by taking courses in art "
"and media, by reading books, and by trial and error. Once you have the "
"conceptual knowledge, you can easily learn Blender (or any other CG "
"package). Learning both at the same time is difficult, since you are dealing"
" with two issues, but not impossible. In this manual, the conceptual "
"knowledge is usually addressed in a short paragraph or two at the beginning "
"of a topic or chapter that explains the topic and provides a workflow, or "
"process, for accomplishing the task. The rest of the manual section "
"addresses the specific capabilities and features of Blender with regard to "
"that task. The user manual cannot give you the full conceptual knowledge - "
"that comes from other sources (books, practice, etc.). You can use Blender "
"to create a feature film, but reading this manual and using Blender won't "
"make you another Steven Spielberg!"
