":kbd:`Ctrl-F3` will take a screenshot of your Blender window and then open "
"the Blender *File Browser* window, allowing you to specify the name and "
"location of the screenshot. In the example image at the right, the PNG "
"format will be the output of the screenshot taken (settings are the same as "
"the ones available to save render results). When the Blender *File Browser* "
"window opens for you, at the left, there is a tab called *Save Screenshot* "
