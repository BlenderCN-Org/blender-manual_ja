"The shortcut :kbd:`Alt-F3` starts the screencast function. Screencasts will "
"record your actions over time either as a video or sequence of image files. "
"The type and location of the output is determined by the settings in the "
":doc:`Output panel </render/output>` of the :doc:`Render context "
"</getting_started/basics/interface/contexts>` window. The default settings "
"will generate a screencast consisting of a series of PNG images captured "
"every 50 ms and stored in the */tmp* folder. If you want to record a video, "
"set the *Output* to one of the *Movie File Formats* supported by your system"
" listed in the *Output panel* format menu. If you are unsure what video "
"codecs your system supports, select *AVI JPEG*."
