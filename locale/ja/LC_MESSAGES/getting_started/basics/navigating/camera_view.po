"Cameras View can be used to virtually compose shots and preview how the "
"scene will look when rendered. Pressing :kbd:`Numpad0` will show the scene "
"as viewed from the currently active camera. In this view you can also set "
"the *Render Border* which defines the portion of the camera view to be "
"rendered."

"While in camera view, you can define a *Render Border* by pressing "
":kbd:`Ctrl-B`. This will allow you to draw out a dotted orange rectangle "
"within the camera view. Your renders will now be limited to the part of "
"scene visible within the render border. This can be very useful for reducing"
" render times. The border can be disabled by disabling the *Border* option "
"in the *Dimensions* panel of the *Render* context or by using :kbd:`Ctrl-B` "
"to set a *Render Border* larger than the camera view."
