"If you are familiar with other 3D software you will immediately notice that "
"Blender is quite different from what you are used to seeing. However you "
"will soon see similarities with your previous software, like a *3D "
"Viewport*, an *Outliner* and a *Timeline*. If this is the first time you "
"have used any 3D software, you may be a little lost. Fortunately there's "
"really only one rule when you want to learn 3D with Blender: don't be afraid"
