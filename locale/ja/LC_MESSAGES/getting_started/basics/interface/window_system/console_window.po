"When Blender is started on a Windows operating system, the *Console Window* "
"is first created as a separate window on the desktop. Assuming that the "
"right start-up conditions are met, the main Blender window should also "

"console again, go to :menuselection:`Window --> Toggle System Console`."

"The Blender *Console Window* must remain open while Blender is running. "
"Closing the *Console Window* will also close Blender, and unsaved work would"

"drop-down menu :menuselection:`Window --> Toggle System Console`."

"The *Blender Console Window* can display many different types of Status and "
"Error Messages. Some messages simply inform the user what Blender is doing, "
"but have no real impact on Blender's ability to function. Other messages can"
" indicate serious errors that will most likely prevent Blender carrying out "
"a particular task and may even make Blender non-responsive or shut down "

msgid ""
"When Blender carries out operations that require extra memory (RAM), it "
"calls a function called malloc (short for memory allocate) which tries to "
"allocate a requested amount of memory for Blender. If this cannot be "
"satisfied, malloc will return nil/null/0 to indicate that it failed to carry"
" out the request. If this happens Blender will not be able to carry out the "
"operation requested by the user. This will most likely result in Blender "
"operating very slowly or shutting down. If you want to avoid running out of "
"memory you can install more memory in your system, reduce the amount of "
"detail in your Blender models, or shut down other programs and services "
"which may be taking up memory that Blender could use."
