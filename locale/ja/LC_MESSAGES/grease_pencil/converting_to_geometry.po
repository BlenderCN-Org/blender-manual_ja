"based on the current view settings, by transforming the points recorded when"
" drawing (which make up the strokes) into 3D-space. Currently, all points "
"will be used, so it may be necessary to simplify or subdivide parts of the "

"Stroke's width will be used to set the curve's control points' radii and "

" its settings - and which might have been modulated by the pen pressure), to"
" multiply it by a given constant (0.1), and to assign it directly to "
"weights. Radii get the same value scaled by the *Radius Fac* factor (e.g. "
