"Because of the co-dependant way in which the :guilabel:`ParticleInstance` "
"modifier is influenced by the underlying particle systems on other objects, "
"some of the apparent effects generated by the :guilabel:`ParticleInstance` "
"modifier can look and act vastly different, depending on the underlying "
"settings of the particle systems it is associated with. This is worth taking"
" account of if the :guilabel:`ParticleInstance` modifier settings don't "
"appear to be giving the results expected, as it may indicate that the "
"particle system settings may need altering rather than the "
":guilabel:`ParticleInstance` modifier settings."

"modifier with another object (usually an object having a particle "

"particles, those particles will have the mesh shape of the current "
":guilabel:`ParticleInstance` modifier's mesh. If for example a sphere has a "
":guilabel:`ParticleInstance` modifier added to it, when the "
":guilabel:`Object` field of this modifier is filled in with the name of an "
"object that emits particles, those particle will be sphere shaped. Even "
"though most of the time the :guilabel:`Object` field will have the name of "
"an object with a particle system, this is not mandatory, you can enter an "
"object's name which does not have a particle system, and it will be accepted"
