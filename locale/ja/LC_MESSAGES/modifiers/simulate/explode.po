msgid ""
"The Explode Modifier is used to alter the mesh geometry (by moving/rotating "
"its faces) in a way that (roughly) tracks underlying emitted particles that "
"makes it look as if the mesh is being exploded (broken apart and pushed "
"outward)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:21
msgid ""
"For the Explode Modifier to have a visible effect on the underlying mesh it "
"has to be applied to a mesh which has a particle system on it, in other "
"words it has to be a mesh which outputs particles. This is because the "
"particle system on the mesh is what controls how a mesh will be exploded, "
"and therefore without the particle system the mesh wont appear to alter.  "
"Also both the number of emitted particles and number of faces determine how "
"granular the Explode Modifier will be. With default settings the more faces "
"and particles the more detailed the mesh exploding will be, because there "
"are more faces and particles to affect detachment/movement of faces."

"This modifier is highly affected by its position within the modifier "
"stacking order.  If it is applied before a Particle System modifier it will "
"not be affected by particles and therefore appear to do nothing.  The "
"Particle System Modifier must appear before the Explode Modifier because the"
