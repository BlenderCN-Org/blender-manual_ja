"The :guilabel:`Mirror` modifier automatically mirrors a mesh along its "
"**local** X, Y and/or Z axes, which pass through the object's center (the "
"mirror plane is then defined by the two other axes). It can also use another"
" object as mirror center, then use that object's local axes instead of its "
"own. It can weld vertices together on the mirror plane within a specified "
"*tolerance* distance. Vertices from the original object can be prevented "
"from moving across or through the mirror plane. And last but not least, it "
"can also mirror vertex groups and UV coordinates."

"understand how the axis applies to the mirror direction, if you were to "
"mirror on the X axis, the X plus values of the original mesh would become X "
"minus values on the mirrored instance. You can select more than one of these"
" axes - you'll then get more mirror instances, so that all planes of "
"symmetry selected are \"fully processed\" (i.e. with one axis you get a "
"single mirror, with two axes four mirrors, and with all three axes eight "

"Usually, the mirrored copies of the vertices of a group remain in this "
"group. Once this option is activated, all groups following the rules "
"described above will only be valid on the original object - the mirrored "
"copy will put these same vertices into the \"mirror\" group. Very handy with"
" armatures, for example: you just model half of your object, carefully rig "
"it with half of your armature, and just let the :guilabel:`Mirror` modifier "
"build the other half. Just be sure to put your :guilabel:`Armature` "

"Many modeling tasks involve creating objects that are symmetrical. However, "
"there used to be no quick way to model both halves of an object without "
"using one of the workarounds that have been discovered by clever Blender "
"artists over the years.  A common technique is to model one half of an "
"object and use :kbd:`alt-D` to create a linked duplicate which can then be "
"mirrored on one axis to produce a perfect mirror-image copy, which updates "
"in real time as you edit."

"To apply a :guilabel:`Mirror` modifier, it is common to have to move the "
"object's center onto the edge or face that is to be the axis for mirroring. "
"This can be tricky when attempted visually. A good technique to achieve an "
"exact position is to determine the edge against which you wish to mirror. "
"Select two vertices on that edge. Then use :kbd:`shift-S` followed by "
":guilabel:`Cursor to Selection` (:kbd:`c`). This will center the 3D cursor "
"exactly on the edge midway between the two vertices. Finally, press :kbd"
":`Ctrl-Alt-Shift-c` for the :guilabel:`Set Origin` popup, then select "
":guilabel:`Origin to 3D Cursor` (:kbd:`t`). This will move the object's "
"center to where the 3D cursor is located, and the mirroring will be exact."
