"The :guilabel:`Decimate` modifier allows you to reduce the vertex/face count"
" of a mesh with minimal shape changes. This is not applicable to meshes "
"which have been created by modeling carefully and economically, where all "
"vertices and faces are necessary to correctly define the shape, but if the "
"mesh is the result of complex modeling, with proportional editing, "
"successive refinements, possibly some conversions from SubSurfed to non-"
"SubSurfed meshes, you might very well end up with meshes where lots of "
"vertices are not really necessary."

"The :guilabel:`Decimate` modifier is a quick and easy way of reducing the "
"polygon count of a mesh non-destructively. This modifier demonstrates the "
"advantages of a mesh modifier system because it shows how an operation which"
" is normally permanent and destroys original mesh data, can be done "
"interactively and safely using a modifier."

"The ratio of faces to keep after decimation, from ``0.0`` (0%, all faces "

"A simple example is a plane, and a 4x4 undeformed :guilabel:`Grid` object. "

"vertices and faces. The :guilabel:`Decimate` modifier allows you to "

msgid ""
"We take a simple example of decimating a cylinder with the default of ``32``"
" segments. This will generate a cylinder with ``96`` faces. When the "
":guilabel:`Decimate` modifier is applied, the face count goes up! This is "
"because the modifier converts all quadrangles (*quads*) into triangles "
"(*tris*) which always increases the face count. Each quad decomposes into "
"two triangles."
