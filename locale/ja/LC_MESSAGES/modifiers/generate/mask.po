#~ msgid ""
#~ "The :guilabel:`Mask` modifier allows certain parts of an object's mesh to be"
#~ " hidden from view (masked off), in effect making the parts of the mesh that "
#~ "are masked act as if they were no longer there."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ "The :guilabel:`Mask` modifier can hide parts of a mesh based on two "
#~ "different modes, selectable from this drop-down list:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "When the :guilabel:`Vertex Group` option is selected, the :guilabel:`Mask` "
#~ "modifier uses the specified vertex group to determine which parts of the "
#~ "mesh are masked by the modifier."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Once you have entered the desired name, the :guilabel:`Mask` modifier will "
#~ "update so that those vertices of the mesh which are part of the named vertex"
#~ " group will be masked (which normally means they will be visible), and "
#~ "anything not part of the named vertex group will be made non-visible. Any of"
#~ " the methods for assigning vertex weights to a mesh work with the "
#~ ":guilabel:`Mask` modifier; however the actual weight value assigned to a "
#~ "vertex group is completely ignored. The :guilabel:`Mask` modifier only takes"
#~ " into account whether a set of vertices are part of a group or not; the "
#~ "weight is not taken into account. So having a vertex group weight of say "
#~ "``0.5`` will not make a partially masked mesh. Just being part of the vertex"
#~ " group is enough for the :guilabel:`Mask` modifier, even if the weight is "
#~ "``0.0``."

#~ "Useful in :guilabel:`Pose Mode` or when editing an armature. Enter the name "
#~ "of the armature object in the text field.  When working with bones in "
#~ ":guilabel:`Pose` mode, vertex groups not associated with the active bone are"
#~ " masked. The :guilabel:`Inverse` button can be useful to see how a bone "
#~ "affects the mesh down the chain of bones."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Normally, when the :guilabel:`Mask` modifier is applied to areas of a mesh, "
#~ "the parts that are under the influence of the modifier are left visible "
#~ "while the parts that aren't are hidden. The :guilabel:`Inverse` button "
#~ "reverses this behavior, in that now parts of the mesh that were not "
#~ "originally visible become visible, and the parts that were visible become "
#~ "hidden."
