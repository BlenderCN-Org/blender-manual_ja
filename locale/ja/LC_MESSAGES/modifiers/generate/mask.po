msgid ""
"The :guilabel:`Mask` modifier allows certain parts of an object's mesh to be"
" hidden from view (masked off), in effect making the parts of the mesh that "
"are masked act as if they were no longer there."

msgid ""
"When the :guilabel:`Vertex Group` option is selected, the :guilabel:`Mask` "
"modifier uses the specified vertex group to determine which parts of the "
"mesh are masked by the modifier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modifiers/generate/mask.rst:31
msgid ""
"Once you have entered the desired name, the :guilabel:`Mask` modifier will "
"update so that those vertices of the mesh which are part of the named vertex"
" group will be masked (which normally means they will be visible), and "
"anything not part of the named vertex group will be made non-visible. Any of"
" the methods for assigning vertex weights to a mesh work with the "
":guilabel:`Mask` modifier; however the actual weight value assigned to a "
"vertex group is completely ignored. The :guilabel:`Mask` modifier only takes"
" into account whether a set of vertices are part of a group or not; the "
"weight is not taken into account. So having a vertex group weight of say "
"``0.5`` will not make a partially masked mesh. Just being part of the vertex"
" group is enough for the :guilabel:`Mask` modifier, even if the weight is "
"``0.0``."

"Useful in :guilabel:`Pose Mode` or when editing an armature. Enter the name "
"of the armature object in the text field.  When working with bones in "
":guilabel:`Pose` mode, vertex groups not associated with the active bone are"
" masked. The :guilabel:`Inverse` button can be useful to see how a bone "
"affects the mesh down the chain of bones."

msgid "Inverse"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modifiers/generate/mask.rst:55
msgid ""
"Normally, when the :guilabel:`Mask` modifier is applied to areas of a mesh, "
"the parts that are under the influence of the modifier are left visible "
"while the parts that aren't are hidden. The :guilabel:`Inverse` button "
"reverses this behavior, in that now parts of the mesh that were not "
"originally visible become visible, and the parts that were visible become "
"hidden."
