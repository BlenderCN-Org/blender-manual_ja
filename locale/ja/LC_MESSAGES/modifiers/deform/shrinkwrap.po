"The :guilabel:`Shrinkwrap` modifier allows an object to \"shrink\" to the "
"surface of another object. It moves each vertex of the object being modified"
" to the closest position on the surface of the given mesh (using one of the "
"three methods available). It can be applied to meshes, lattices, curves, "
"surfaces and texts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modifiers/deform/shrinkwrap.rst:23
msgid ""
"Like most of the deform modifiers, the affected \"vertices\" are the "
"\"computed\" one, i.e. the real geometry of the object at the time the "
"modifier is calculated, and not the original *vertices* /control points."

"Something of a view-independent :doc:`retopo tool "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/retopo>` (in Blender 2.49), :guilabel:`Shrinkwrap`"
" projects vertices along their normals or moved to the nearest surface "
"point. But it doesn't have accuracy problems like retopo did, since it works"
" in object space instead of image space. Also it's possible to \"keep a "
"distance\" from the target position."

" settings (especially the :guilabel:`Negative` / :guilabel:`Positive` ones),"
" or move one of the objects around... This method is the hardest to master, "
