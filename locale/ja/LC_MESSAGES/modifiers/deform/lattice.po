#: ../../manual/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:31
msgid ""
"A lattice consists of a three-dimensional non-renderable grid of vertices. "
"Its main use is to give extra deformation capabilities to the underlying "
"object it controls (either *via* a modifier, or as its parent). Objects to "
"be deformed can be meshes, curves, surfaces, text, lattices and even "
"particles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:36
msgid ""
"The lattice should be scaled and moved to fit around your object in object "
"mode. Any scaling applied to the object in edit mode will result in the "
"object deforming. This includes applying scale with :kbd:`Ctrl-A` as this "
"will achieve the same result as scaling the lattice in edit mode, and "
"therefore the object."

"A Lattice Modifier can quickly be added to selected objects by selecting "

#~ msgid ""
#~ "First of all: it's easier. Since your mesh could have a zillion vertices, "

#~ "It's fast! You can use the same lattice to deform several meshes. Just give "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "It's a good practice. A lattice can be used to get different versions of a "
#~ "mesh with minimal extra work and consumption of resources. This leads to an "
#~ "optimal scene design, minimizing the amount of modeling work. A lattice does"
#~ " not affect the texture coordinates of a mesh's surface. Subtle changes to "
