"A lattice consists of a non-renderable three-dimensional grid of vertices. "
"Its main use is to give extra deformation capabilities to the underlying "
"object it controls (either *via* a modifier, or as its parent). Objects to "
"be deformed can be meshes, curves, surfaces, text, lattices and even "
"particles."

"The lattice should be scaled and moved to fit around your object in object "
"mode. Any scaling applied to the object in edit mode will result in the "
"object deforming. This includes applying scale with :kbd:`ctrl-A` as this "
"will achieve the same result as scaling the lattice in edit mode, and "
"therefore the object."

"Why would you use a lattice to deform a mesh instead of deforming the mesh "
"itself in :guilabel:`Edit mode` ? There are a couple of reasons for that:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:56
msgid ""
"First of all: it's easier. Since your mesh could have a zillion vertices, "
"scaling, grabbing and moving them could be a hard task. Instead, if you use "
"a nice simple lattice your job is simplified to moving just a couple of "
"vertices."

"It's fast! You can use the same lattice to deform several meshes. Just give "
"each object a lattice modifier, all pointing to the same lattice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:59
msgid ""
"It's a good practice. A lattice can be used to get different versions of a "
"mesh with minimal extra work and consumption of resources. This leads to an "
"optimal scene design, minimizing the amount of modeling work. A lattice does"
" not affect the texture coordinates of a mesh's surface. Subtle changes to "
"mesh objects are easily facilitated in this way, and do not change the mesh "
"itself."
