"Real world camera lenses and your eyeball transmit light through a lens "
"(cornea) that bends the light, and an iris that limits the amount of light, "
"to focus the image onto the film, CCD/Cmos sensor, or retina. Because of the"
" interaction of the lens and iris, objects that are a certain distance away "
"are in focus; objects in the foreground and background are out of focus. We "
"call this distance their depth, or \"Z\" distance from the camera or eye."

"Light comes to the lens (in the real world) at an angle; from some "
"direction. What you see depends on your perspective; if you move closer, "
"different angles of the scene are revealed. To make \"flat\" pictures, like "
"an architectural drawing or plot, Blender can also make an orthographic "
"rendering. So, there are two kinds of renderings, Perspective and "
"Orthographic. Perspective simulates light coming in at an angle to the lens "
"from the field of view, and Orthographic (disabled by default) simulates "
"light coming straight in to an infinitely large backplane or flat retina."

"Depending on the diameter of the iris, there is a range (of distance) where "
"objects are in focus. In cameras, the diameter of the iris is controlled by "
"an \"f-stop\". Said another way, there is *field* of view that you see left "
"to right, up and down; your \"picture\", if you will. At a certain range, or"
" *depth* away from your eye, things are in focus. For example, at night, you"
" may be able to focus your eye on objects that are 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 "
"meters) away. Anything closer than 10 or farther away than 15 is blurry. "
"Your **depth of field** is thus 5 feet (2 m)."

"The larger the iris, the smaller the depth of field. This is why, during the"
" day, you can focus on a range of things stretching out far from you. In "

"The more that an object is out of its depth (the perfect value for this "
"depth is called *focal plane*), the blurrier it is. In fact, the depth of "
"field is the range on both sides of the focal plane in which the blurriness "
"of the objects is considered to be low enough to be imperceptible. In "
"Blender, this distance is called the *Dof Dist* or \"Depth of Field "
"Distance\" and is set in the *Editing* context (:kbd:`F9`) for the camera. "
"Alternatively, you can have the camera automatically stay focused on an "
"object, by entering the name of the object in the *Dof Ob* field."

"The field of view varies by the size of the lens. With cameras, a 35mm lens "

"Blender, use the *Camera* settings to change the size of the lens (35mm is "
"the default). A longer lens taking a picture farther away has the same field"

"\"traveling\" than \"zooming\"). Blender allows you both actions: you can "
"move the camera closer to or farther away from an object for a track (or "

"In computer graphics (CG), there is no physical lens or iris, so the depth-"

" artistic reasons, we want our main characters to be in focus, and "
"everything else a little blurry, so that our audience does not focus on "
"distracting things in the background. Also, it is easier to discern the main"

"Freestyle is an edge- and line-based non-photorealistic (NPR) rendering "

"big brush, cartoon, blueprint, thickness-with-depth are already pre-scripted"
