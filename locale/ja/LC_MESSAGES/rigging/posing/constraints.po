"The Constraints panel in Pose mode, with one Floor constraint applied to the"
" active bone (Bone.001)."

"As bones behave like objects in :guilabel:`Pose` mode, they can also be "
"constrained. This is why the :guilabel:`Constraints` panel is shown in both "
":guilabel:`Object` and :guilabel:`Editing` contexts in this mode... This "
"panel contains the constraints *of the active bone* (its name is displayed "
"at the top of the panel, in the :guilabel:`To Bone:...` static text field)."

"Constraining bones can be used to control their degree of freedom in their "
"pose transformations, using e.g. the :guilabel:`Limit` constraints. You can "
"also use constraints to make a bone track another object/bone (inside the "
"same object, or in another armature), etc. And the :doc:`inverse kinematics "
"feature </rigging/posing/inverse_kinematics>` is also mainly available "
"through the :guilabel:`IK Solver` constraint - which is specific to bones."

"For example, a human elbow can't rotate backward (unless the character has "
"broken his hand), nor to the sides, and its forward and roll rotations are "
"limited in a given range (for example, depending on the rest position of "
"your elbow, it may be from ``0`` to ``160``, OR from ``-45`` to ``135``)."

"So you should apply a :guilabel:`Limit Rotation` constraint to the forearm "
"bone (as the elbow movement is the result of rotating the forearm bone "
"around its root)."

"Using bones in constraints, either as owners or as targets, is discussed in "
