"FIXME(Template Unsupported: Template:Warning/Important; "
"{{Template:Warning/Important}} ) One important thing to understand about "
"armature editing is that you **edit the rest position of your armature**, "
"i.e. its \"default state\". An armature in its *rest position* has all bones"
" with no rotation and scaled to **1.0** in their own local space."

"The different :doc:`poses </rigging/posing>` you might create afterwards are"
" based on this rest position - so if you modify it in :guilabel:`Edit mode`,"
" all the poses already existing will also be modified. Thus you should in "
"general be sure that your armature is definitive before starting to "
":doc:`skin </rigging/skinning>` and :doc:`pose </rigging/posing>` it!"
