"Proportional Edit is a way of transforming selected elements (such as "
"vertices) while having that transformation affect other nearby elements. For"
" example, having the movement of a single vertex cause the movement of "
"unselected vertices within a given range. Unselected vertices that are "
"closer to the selected vertex will move more than those farther from it "
"(i.e. they will move proportionally relative to the location of the selected"
" element). Since proportional editing affects the nearby geometry, it is "
"very useful when you need to smoothly deform the surface of a dense mesh."
