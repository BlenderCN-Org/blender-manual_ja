":guilabel:`Push/Pull` will move the selected elements (Objects, vertices, "
"edges or faces) closer together (Push) or further apart (Pull). "
"Specifically, each element is moved towards or away from the center by the "
"same distance. This distance is controlled by moving the mouse up (Push) or "
"down (Pull), numeric input or through slider control."

"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the Push/Pull "
"transform function. The Push/Pull option can be invoked from the "
":menuselection:`Object/Mesh --> Transform --> Push/Pull` menu option or by "
"pressing :kbd:`space` and using the search menu to search for "
":guilabel:`Push` or :guilabel:`Pull`. The amount of movement given to the "
"selection can be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a"
" number. Pressing :kbd:`Enter` will confirm the transformation. The "
"confirmed transformation can be further edited by pressing F6 or by going "
"into the Toolshelf (:kbd:`T`) and altering the Distance slider provided that"
" no other actions take place between the :guilabel:`Push/Pull` transform "
"confirmation and accessing the slider."

"Note that the result of the :guilabel:`Push/Pull` transform is also "
"dependant on the number and type of selected elements (Objects, vertices, "
"faces etc). See below for the result of using :guilabel:`Push/Pull` on a "
"number of different elements."
