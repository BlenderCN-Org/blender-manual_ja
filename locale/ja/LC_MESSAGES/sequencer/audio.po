"Audio-RAM loads a file into memory and plays it from there. You can only "
"load stand-alone WAV files. Audio-HD plays the sound back from the hard disk"
" and thus does not take up memory. With Audio HD, you can load stand-alone "
"WAV files, but also audio tracks from movies."

"For either, a green audio strip will be created. With Audio RAM, a waveform "
"is created that shows you the waveform inside the green strip, scaled to the"
" height of the green strip. Since Audio-RAM files are read into memory, "
"changing the audio file will not affect playback, and you will have to re-"
"open the file so that Blender re-reads the file."

"Some audiophile users report that Hiss is introduced sometimes if Audio RAM "
"is used. There must be some decoding or sampling going on, that does not "
"occur when Audio HD is used, that introduces some playback noise. If you "
"hear pops and crackles, usually that is a sign that your hardware cannot "
"keep up in real-time playback. They will not be present in your final "
"rendered animation output (but they may show up in Game mode)."

"You can have as many Audio strips as you wish and the result will be the "
"mixing of all of them. You can give each strip its own name and Gain (in dB)"
" via the :kbd:`N` menu. This also let you set a strip to mute or 'Pan' it; "
"-1 is hard left, +1 is hard right, with percentages in-between."

"Overlapping strips are automatically mixed down during ANIM processing. For "

" Blender an audio mixer. By adding audio tracks and using the curves to "
