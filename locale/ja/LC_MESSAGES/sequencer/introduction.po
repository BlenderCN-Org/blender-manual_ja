"In addition to modeling and animation, Blender has a fully functional Video "
"Sequence Editor (VSE) as well as an advanced node-based editor that also "
"manipulates a video stream. :doc:`Compositing Nodes "
"</composite_nodes/types>` operate equally well on images or video streams, "
"and can apply detailed image manipulation on the stream."

"Operating at a higher conceptual level, and used later in the video "
"production process, Blender's legacy VSE operates on a set of entire strips "
"at a time, as a chunk of footage. The many parts of Blender work together in"
" typical work flow fashion:"

"The VSE within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows you to"
" combine multiple video channels and add effects to them. Its functionality "
"has been inside Blender since the beginning. Even though it has a limited "
"number of operations, you can use these to create powerful video edits "
"(especially when you combine it with the animation power of Blender!) "
"Furthermore, it is extensible via a plugin system to perform an unlimited "
"number of image manipulations."

"Using the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or in "
"some cases, overlay them), inserting fades and transitions to link the end "
"of one clip to the beginning of another. Finally, add an audio track so you "
"can synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it. The result of "
"using the VSE is your finished movie."
