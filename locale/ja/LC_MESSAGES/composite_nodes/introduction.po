"Compositing Nodes allow you to assemble and enhance an image (or movie). "
"Using composition nodes, you can glue two pieces of footage together and "
"colorize the whole sequence all at once. You can enhance the colors of a "
"single image or an entire movie clip in a static manner or in a dynamic way "
"that changes over time (as the clip progresses). In this way, you use "
"composition nodes to both assemble video clips together, and enhance them."

"To use this mini-map, you must now tell Blender to use the Compositing Node "
"map that has been created, and to composite the image using composition "
"nodes. To do so, switch to the :guilabel:`Render` button area and activate "
"the :guilabel:`Compositing` button located below the :guilabel:`Post "
"Processing` tab. This tells Blender to composite the final image by running "
"it through the composition node map."
