"Vector nodes manipulate information about how light interacts with the "
"scene, multiplying vector sets, and other wonderful things that normal "
"humans barely comprehend (except math geniuses, who may not be considered "
"'normal'). Even if you aren't a math wiz, you'll find these nodes to be very"

"You can also use the map value node to multiply values to achieve an output "

"Value node multiplies the input by 2, resulting in an output value that "
"scales from 0.00 to 2.00 over 30 frames. The *second* Map Value node "
"subtracts 1 from the input, giving working values between -1.00 and 1.00, "

"150 over a 30-frame sequence."
