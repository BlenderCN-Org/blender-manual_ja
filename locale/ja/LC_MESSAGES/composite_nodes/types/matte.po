"In the example to the right (click to expand), we have a purple cube with "
"yellow marbeling in front of a very unevenly lit green screen. We start "
"building our noodle by threading the image to a difference key, and using "
"the eyedropper, pick a key color very close to the edge of the cube, around "
"where the halo is  at the corner on the left-hand side; a fairly bright "
"green. We thread two viewers from the output sockets so we can see what (if "
"anything) the node is doing. We add an AlphaOver node, threading the Matte "
"to the **TOP** socket and the image to the **BOTTOM** socket. Very "
"Important, because 0 time blue is not the same as blue times zero. You "
"always want your mask to go to the top socket of the AlphaOver. Premultiply "
"is set and a full multiply is on so that we completely remove the green. In "
"this example, we thread the output of the alphaover to a SplitViewer node so"
" we can compare our results; the original is threaded to the bottom input of"
" the SplitViewer, so that original is on the left, processed is on the "
"right."

"We set our variance to .15, and see what we get. What we get (not shown) is "
"a matte that masks around the cube, but not on the right and around the "
"edges where the green is darker; that shade it is too far away from our key "
"color. So, since it is the green that is varying that we want to remove, we "
"increase the Green variation to 1.00 (not shown). Whoa! All the Green "
"disappears (all green within a 100% variation of our green key color is "
"*all* the green), along with the top of the box! Not good. So, we start "
"decreasing the green until we settle on 55% (shown)."

"we want. If we wanted to use the matte, we have to switch the white and the "
"black. How to do this? ColorRamp to the rescue - we set the left color White"
" Alpha 1.0, and the right color to be Black Alpha 0.0. Thus, when the "

"Now to mix, we don't really need the AlphaOver node; we can just use the "

" white (1.0) where we don't want to use the model picture, we feed the "
"background photo to the bottom socket (recall the mix node uses the top "
"socket where the factor is 0.0, and the bottom socket where the factor is "
"1.0). Feeding our original photo into the top socket means it will be used "
